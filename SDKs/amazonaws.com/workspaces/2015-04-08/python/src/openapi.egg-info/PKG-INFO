### SDK SDK

* `associate_connection_alias` - <p>Associates the specified connection alias with the specified directory to enable cross-Region redirection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html"> Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces</a>.</p> <note> <p>Before performing this operation, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeConnectionAliases.html"> DescribeConnectionAliases</a> to make sure that the current state of the connection alias is <code>CREATED</code>.</p> </note>
* `associate_ip_groups` - Associates the specified IP access control group with the specified directory.
* `authorize_ip_rules` - <p>Adds one or more rules to the specified IP access control group.</p> <p>This action gives users permission to access their WorkSpaces from the CIDR address ranges specified in the rules.</p>
* `copy_workspace_image` - <p>Copies the specified image from the specified Region to the current Region. For more information about copying images, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/copy-custom-image.html"> Copy a Custom WorkSpaces Image</a>.</p> <p>In the China (Ningxia) Region, you can copy images only within the same Region.</p> <p>In Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US), to copy images to and from other Regions, contact Amazon Web Services Support.</p> <important> <p>Before copying a shared image, be sure to verify that it has been shared from the correct Amazon Web Services account. To determine if an image has been shared and to see the ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns an image, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceImages.html">DescribeWorkSpaceImages</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceImagePermissions.html">DescribeWorkspaceImagePermissions</a> API operations. </p> </important>
* `create_connect_client_add_in` - <p>Creates a client-add-in for Amazon Connect within a directory. You can create only one Amazon Connect client add-in within a directory.</p> <p>This client add-in allows WorkSpaces users to seamlessly connect to Amazon Connect.</p>
* `create_connection_alias` - Creates the specified connection alias for use with cross-Region redirection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html"> Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces</a>.
* `create_ip_group` - <p>Creates an IP access control group.</p> <p>An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the IP addresses from which users are allowed to access their WorkSpaces. To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control group and then associate the group with your directory. You can add rules when you create the group or at any time using <a>AuthorizeIpRules</a>.</p> <p>There is a default IP access control group associated with your directory. If you don't associate an IP access control group with your directory, the default group is used. The default group includes a default rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere. You cannot modify the default IP access control group for your directory.</p>
* `create_standby_workspaces` - Creates a standby WorkSpace in a secondary Region.
* `create_tags` - Creates the specified tags for the specified WorkSpaces resource.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
