 *
 * Valid values are:
 *   - 'received': The consent data have been received and are technically correct.
 *     The data is not authorised yet.
 *   - 'rejected': The consent data have been rejected e.g. since no successful authorisation has taken place.
 *   - 'valid': The consent is accepted and valid for GET account data calls and others as specified in the consent object.
 *   - 'revokedByPsu': The consent has been revoked by the PSU towards the ASPSP.
 *   - 'expired': The consent expired.
 *   - 'terminatedByTpp': The corresponding TPP has terminated the consent by applying the DELETE method to the consent resource.
 *   - 'partiallyAuthorised': The consent is due to a multi-level authorisation, some but not all mandated authorisations have been performed yet.
 *
 * The ASPSP might add further codes. These codes then shall be contained in the ASPSP's documentation of the XS2A interface
 * and has to be added to this API definition as well.
