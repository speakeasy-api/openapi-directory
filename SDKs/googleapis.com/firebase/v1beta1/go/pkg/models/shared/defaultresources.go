	// Output only. The default Firebase Hosting site name, in the format: PROJECT_ID Though rare, your `projectId` might already be used as the name for an existing Hosting site in another project (learn more about creating non-default, [additional sites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites)). In these cases, your `projectId` is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Hosting site name. For example, if your `projectId` is `myproject123`, your default Hosting site name might be: `myproject123-a5c16`

	// Output only. The ID of the Project's default GCP resource location. The location is one of the available [GCP resource locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations). This field is omitted if the default GCP resource location has not been finalized yet. To set a Project's default GCP resource location, call [`FinalizeDefaultLocation`](../projects.defaultLocation/finalize) after you add Firebase resources to the Project.

In these cases, your `projectId` is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Realtime Database instance name. For example, if your `projectId` is `myproject123`, your default database instance name might be: `myproject123-a5c16`
