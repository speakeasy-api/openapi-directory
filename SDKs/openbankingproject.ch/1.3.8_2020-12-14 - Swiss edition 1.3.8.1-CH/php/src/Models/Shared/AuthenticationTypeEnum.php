/**
 * Type of the authentication method.
 * 
 * 
 * More authentication types might be added during implementation projects and documented in the ASPSP documentation.
 * 
 *   - 'SMS_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP linked to the transaction to be authorised is sent to the PSU through a SMS channel.
 *   - 'CHIP_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP is generated by a chip card, e.g. a TOP derived from an EMV cryptogram. 
 *     To contact the card, the PSU normally needs a (handheld) device. 
 *     With this device, the PSU either reads the challenging data through a visual interface like flickering or 
 *     the PSU types in the challenge through the device key pad. 
 *     The device then derives an OTP from the challenge data and displays the OTP to the PSU.
 *   - 'PHOTO_OTP': An SCA method, where the challenge is a QR code or similar encoded visual data
 *     which can be read in by a consumer device or specific mobile app.
 *     The device resp. the specific app than derives an OTP from the visual challenge data and displays
 *     the OTP to the PSU.
 *   - 'PUSH_OTP': An OTP is pushed to a dedicated authentication APP and displayed to the PSU.
 *   - 'SMTP_OTP': An OTP is sent via email to the PSU.
