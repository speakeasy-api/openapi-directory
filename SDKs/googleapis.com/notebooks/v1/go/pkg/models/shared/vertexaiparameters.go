	// Environment variables. At most 100 environment variables can be specified and unique. Example: `GCP_BUCKET=gs://my-bucket/samples/`
	Env map[string]string `json:"env,omitempty"`
	// The full name of the Compute Engine [network](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) to which the Job should be peered. For example, `projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC`. [Format](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networks/insert) is of the form `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`. Where `{project}` is a project number, as in `12345`, and `{network}` is a network name. Private services access must already be configured for the network. If left unspecified, the job is not peered with any network.
