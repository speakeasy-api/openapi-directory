## SDK Installation

### Composer

To install the SDK first add the below to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
composer update
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

### projects

* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsAuthorizationPoliciesCreate` - Creates a new AuthorizationPolicy in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsAuthorizationPoliciesList` - Lists AuthorizationPolicies in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsClientTlsPoliciesCreate` - Creates a new ClientTlsPolicy in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsClientTlsPoliciesList` - Lists ClientTlsPolicies in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsList` - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsOperationsList` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesCreate` - Creates a new ServerTlsPolicy in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesDelete` - Deletes a single ServerTlsPolicy.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesGet` - Gets details of a single ServerTlsPolicy.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesGetIamPolicy` - Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesList` - Lists ServerTlsPolicies in a given project and location.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesPatch` - Updates the parameters of a single ServerTlsPolicy.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesSetIamPolicy` - Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.
* `networksecurityProjectsLocationsServerTlsPoliciesTestIamPermissions` - Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
