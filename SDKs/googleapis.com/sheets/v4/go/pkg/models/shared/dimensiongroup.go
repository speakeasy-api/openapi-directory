// DimensionGroup - A group over an interval of rows or columns on a sheet, which can contain or be contained within other groups. A group can be collapsed or expanded as a unit on the sheet.
type DimensionGroup struct {
	// This field is true if this group is collapsed. A collapsed group remains collapsed if an overlapping group at a shallower depth is expanded. A true value does not imply that all dimensions within the group are hidden, since a dimension's visibility can change independently from this group property. However, when this property is updated, all dimensions within it are set to hidden if this field is true, or set to visible if this field is false.
	Collapsed *bool `json:"collapsed,omitempty"`
	// The depth of the group, representing how many groups have a range that wholly contains the range of this group.
	Depth *int `json:"depth,omitempty"`
	// A range along a single dimension on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open: the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.
	Range *DimensionRange `json:"range,omitempty"`
