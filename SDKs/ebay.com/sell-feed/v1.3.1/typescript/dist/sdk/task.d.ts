The feed type specified sets the task as a download or an upload task. For details about the upload and download flows, see Working with Order Feeds in the Selling Integration Guide. Note: The scope depends on the feed type. An error message results when an unsupported scope or feed type is specified.

     * getTasks - This method returns the details and status for an array of tasks based on a specified feed_type or scheduledId. Specifying both feed_type and scheduledId results in an error. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type. If specifying the feed_type, limit which tasks are returned by specifying filters, such as the creation date range or period of time using look_back_days. Also, by specifying the feed_type, both on-demand and scheduled reports are returned. If specifying a scheduledId, the schedule template (that the schedule ID is based on) determines which tasks are returned (see schedule_id for additional information). Each scheduledId applies to one feed_type.

     * uploadFile - This method associates the specified file with the specified task ID and uploads the input file. After the file has been uploaded, the processing of the file begins. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this method to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Use the getTask with the task ID or getTasks to determine the status of a report. The status flow is QUEUED &gt; IN_PROCESS &gt; COMPLETED or COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR. When the status is COMPLETED or COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR, this indicates the file has been processed and the order report can be downloaded. If there are errors, they will be indicated in the report file. For details of how this method is used in the upload flow, see Working with Order Feeds in the Selling Integration Guide. Note: This method applies to all File Exchange feed types and LMS feed types except LMS_ORDER_REPORT and LMS_ACTIVE_INVENTORY_REPORT.
