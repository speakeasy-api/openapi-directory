/**
 * Probely is a Web Vulnerability Scanning suite for Agile Teams. It provides
 *
 * @remarks
 * continuous scanning of your Web Applications and lets you efficiently
 * manage the lifecycle of the vulnerabilities found, in a sleek and
 * intuitive ~~web interface~~ API.
 *
 * ## Quick-Start
 *
 * ### Authentication
 *
 * To use the API, you first need to create a token (API Key).
 * To create a token, select a target from the drop-down list, go to the
 * "Settings" page, and click on the "Integrations" tab.
 *
 * Write a name for the API Key. For example, if you want to use the API Key
 * for travis,
 * you could name it "travis". In this example, we chose "**example.com_key**"
 *
 * ![Creating API key][1]
 *
 *   [1]: assets/qs/create_api_key_1.png
 *
 *
 *
 * The API key was created successfully:
 *
 * ![API key created][2]
 *
 *   [2]: assets/qs/create_api_key_2.png
 *
 *
 * On every request, you need to pass this token in the authorization header,
 * like this:
 *
 *
 * ```yaml
 * Authorization: JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJBRlNJQlp
 * 3elFsMDEiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IkNIZ2tkSUROdzV0NSJ9.90UwiPGS2hlvgOLktFU0LfKuatNKm
 * mEP79u17VnqT9M
 * ```
 *
 *
 * **WARNING: Treat this token as a password. With this token, you have the
 * power to fully manage the target.**
 *
 * In the following examples, the token will be named as *PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN*.
 *
 *
 * ### Scan target
 *
 * First let's view our target list:
 *
 * ```bash
 * curl https://api.probely.com/targets/ \
 *   -X GET \
 *   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *   -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
 * ```
 *
 *
 * From the results, we need the **target id**:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "count":1,
 *    "page_total":1,
 *    "page":1,
 *    "length":10,
 *    "results":[
 *       {
 *          "id":"AxtkqTE0v3E-",
 *          "name":"test-site",
 *          "desc":"",
 *          "url":"https://test-site.example.com",
 *          "settings":
 *             "(...)"
 *          ,
 *          "stack":
 *             "(...)"
 *          ,
 *          "verified":true,
 *          "(...)": "(...)"
 *       }
 *    ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Now we can send a request to start a scan on target id **AxtkqTE0v3E-**
 *
 * ```bash
 * curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scan_now/ \
 *   -X POST \
 *   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *   -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
 * ```
 *
 *
 * And we get a response saying that the scan is scheduled: the status is **queued**, and we've got a **scan id**:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "changed":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
 *    "started":null,
 *    "completed":null,
 *    "mediums":0,
 *    "changed_by":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "highs":0,
 *    "status":"queued",
 *    "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
 *    "created_by":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "target":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
 *    "lows":0
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Using the scan id **S6dOMPn0SnoH**, we can pool the scan status:
 *
 * ```bash
 * curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scans/S6dOMPn0SnoH/ \
 *   -X GET \
 *   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *   -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
 * ```
 *
 *
 * And we get a response saying that the scan status is now **started**:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
 *    "changed":"2017-08-01T13:38:12.623650Z",
 *    "started":null,
 *    "completed":null,
 *    "mediums":0,
 *    "changed_by":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "highs":0,
 *    "status":"started",
 *    "created_by":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "target":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
 *    "lows":0
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * The possible statuses are:
 *
 * | Status | Name | Description |
 * | ------ | ---- | ----------- |
 * | queued | Queued | The scan is queued to start |
 * | started | Started | The scan is currently running |
 * | under_review | Under Review | The scan is complete but has some findings under review |
 * | completed | Completed | The scan is complete |
 * | completed_with_errors | Completed with errors | The scan is complete even after getting some error(s) |
 * | failed | Failed | The scan failed |
 * | canceled | Canceled | The scan was canceled |
 * | canceling | Canceling | The scan is being canceled |
 *
 *
 * During the scan, the keys "lows", "mediums", and "highs" will be updated
 * with the findings, as they are being found.
 *
 * After we get either the status **completed** or **completed_with_errors**,
 * we can view the findings.
 *
 *
 * ### Get vulnerabilities
 *
 * Using the previous scan id **S6dOMPn0SnoH**, we can get the scan results:
 *
 * ```bash
 * curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scans/S6dOMPn0SnoH/ \
 *   -X GET \
 *   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *   -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
 * ```
 *
 * We get a response saying that the scan status is now **completed**, and
 * that **45** vulnerabilities were found. **14** low, **11** medium and
 * **20** high:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
 *    "target":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "status":"completed",
 *    "started":"2017-08-01T13:37:12.623650Z",
 *    "completed":"2017-08-01T14:17:48.559514Z",
 *    "lows":14,
 *    "mediums":11,
 *    "highs":20,
 *    "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
 *    "created_by":
 *     "(...)"
 *    ,
 *    "changed":"2017-08-01T14:17:48.559514Z",
 *    "changed_by":
 *     "(...)"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can now view the results of this scan, or the target findings.
 *
 *
 * Let's start with the scan results:
 *
 * ```bash
 * curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/findings/?scan=S6dOMPn0SnoH&page=1 \
 *   -X GET \
 *   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *   -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
 * ```
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "count":45,
 *    "page_total":5,
 *    "page":1,
 *    "length":10,
 *    "results":[
 *       {
 *          "id":79,
 *          "target":

 *          ,
 *          "scans":
 *           "(...)"
 *          ,
 *          "labels":
 *           "(...)"
 *          ,
 *          "fix":"To fix an SQL Injection in PHP, you should use Prepared Statements.

 *
 *
 * ### Get vulnerability details

 *
 * ## Concepts
 *
 * The short version is that you run *scans* on *targets*, and *findings* are
 * created for any issue that is found.
 * However, there are a few more concepts that must be explained in order to
 * get a complete picture of how Probely works.
 * We will spend the next few sections detailing the most important concepts.
 *
 *
 * ### Target
 *
 * A *target* defines the scope of a scan, what will and won't be included
 * in the scan plan.
 * This is done by filling a *target*'s *site* and *assets*.
 *
 * The entry point for the web application (and authentication) is setup
 * in the *target*'s *site*.
 *
 * In modern web applications, you are probably loading resources from
 * multiple domains.
 * A single page app, for example, will usualy load the page from one domain
 * and make AJAX requests to another.
 * This is what *assets* are for: they specify what domains our scanner should
 * follow and create requests for.
 *
 *
 * ### Site
 * A URL is probably not the only thing you will need to setup when scannning your application.
 * Does the application have an authenticated area? Does it use basic auth?
 * Does it expect a certain cookie or header?
 * These parameters are all configured in the *target*'s *site*.
 *
 *
 * We need to ensure that only allowed web applications are scanned.
 * Therefore, we must verify that you have control of any site you wish to include.
 * This can be done by:
 *   * Placing a file on a well-known location, on the site's server;
 *   * Creating specific DNS records.
 *
 *
 * ### Asset
 *
 * An *asset* is very similar to a *site*. The difference is that it is a domain instead
 * of a URL. Additionally, an *asset* has no login or basic auth support.
 * You can still have custom cookies and headers per *asset*.
 *
 * As with the *site*, you will need to prove an *asset*'s ownership. We have added some
 * rules to make your life easier, if you already have verified
 * a *site* and the domains match, the validation is fast-tracked.
 *
 * ### Scans
 *
 * This is what you're here for.
 * After configuring your *target*, you will want to run *scans* against it.
 * You can either start a one off scan, or schedule one for later - recurring
 * or not.
 *
 * During the *scan*, we will spider and run several modules to check for
 * security issues, which we call *findings*.
 * You can check the *findings* even before a scan ends.
 * If everything goes well, the scan will complete and that is it.
 *
 * With some *findings*, our automated processes may have difficulties
 * determining if it is a false positive or a legitimate issue.
 * In these instances, a scan will be marked as under review, and we will
 * further analyze the finding before making a decision.
 * We will only show findings that, for some degree of confidence, are true
 * positives.
 * A finding that we are not sure of will never be displayed.
 *
 * As much as we try to prevent it, a *scan* (or a sub-module) can malfunction.
 * If this happens, a *scan* is marked as:
 *   * "failed": the problem was irrecoverable;
 *   * "completed with errors": some module failed but the scan itself completed.
 *
 * During a scan, we try to determine what *frameworks* you are using
 * and add this information to the *site* and *asset* objects discussed
 * previously.
 *
 *
 * ### Findings
 *
 * The last core concept is the *finding*, this is a security issue that
 * we have found during our scans.
 * If the same issue is found in a new scan it will not open a new finding but
 * update the previous.
 *
 * A *finding* will have a lot of information about the issue.
 * Namely, where it was found, URL, insertion point (e.g. cookie), parameter,
 * and method.
 * Evidence we gathered, and the full request and response that we used.
 * Sugestions of how to go about fixing it.
 * A full description of the vulnerability is also present in the
 * *definition* property.
 * We also assign a severity and calculate the CVSS score for each.
 *
 * Besides all this, there are also actions that you can perform on a *finding*.
 * You can assign it to one user, leave comments for your team or add labels,
 * and reduce or increase the severity.
 *
 * If you don't plan on fixing the *finding* and accept the risk, or you think
 * we reported a false positive, you can mark the finding to reflect that.
