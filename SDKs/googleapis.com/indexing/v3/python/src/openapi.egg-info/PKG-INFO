## Available Resources and Operations


### url_notifications

* `indexing_url_notifications_get_metadata` - Gets metadata about a Web Document. This method can _only_ be used to query URLs that were previously seen in successful Indexing API notifications. Includes the latest `UrlNotification` received via this API.
* `indexing_url_notifications_publish` - Notifies that a URL has been updated or deleted.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
