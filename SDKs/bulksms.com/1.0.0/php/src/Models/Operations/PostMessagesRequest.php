     * When using this setting on the API, you should take case to ensure that your message is _clean_.  
     * 
     * Invisible unicode and unexpected characters could unintentionally convert an message to `UNICODE`.  A common mistake is to use the backtick character (\`) which is unicode and will turn your `TEXT` message into a `UNICODE` message.
