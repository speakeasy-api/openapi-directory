/**
 * This data element is containing information about the status of the SCA method applied.
 * 
 * 
 * The following codes are defined for this data type.
 * 
 *   * 'received':
 *     An authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been created successfully.
 *   * 'psuIdentified':
 *     The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified.
 *   * 'psuAuthenticated':
 *     The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified and authenticated e.g. by a password or by an access token.
 *   * 'scaMethodSelected':
 *     The PSU/TPP has selected the related SCA routine.
 *     If the SCA method is chosen implicitly since only one SCA method is available,
 *     then this is the first status to be reported instead of 'received'.
 *   * 'unconfirmed':
 *     SCA is technically successfully finalised by the PSU, but the authorisation resource needs a confirmation command by the TPP yet. 
 *   * 'started':
 *     The addressed SCA routine has been started.
 *   * 'finalised':
 *     The SCA routine has been finalised successfully (including a potential confirmation command). 
 *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
 *   * 'failed':
 *     The SCA routine failed.
 *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
 *   * 'exempted':
 *     SCA was exempted for the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful.
 *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
