// RouteStatus - RouteStatus communicates the observed state of the Route (from the controller).
type RouteStatus struct {
	// Information for connecting over HTTP(s).
	Address *Addressable `json:"address,omitempty"`
	// Conditions communicates information about ongoing/complete reconciliation processes that bring the "spec" inline with the observed state of the world.
	Conditions []GoogleCloudRunV1Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`
	// ObservedGeneration is the 'Generation' of the Route that was last processed by the controller. Clients polling for completed reconciliation should poll until observedGeneration = metadata.generation and the Ready condition's status is True or False. Note that providing a TrafficTarget that has latest_revision=True will result in a Route that does not increment either its metadata.generation or its observedGeneration, as new "latest ready" revisions from the Configuration are processed without an update to the Route's spec.
	ObservedGeneration *int `json:"observedGeneration,omitempty"`
	// Traffic holds the configured traffic distribution. These entries will always contain RevisionName references. When ConfigurationName appears in the spec, this will hold the LatestReadyRevisionName that was last observed.
	Traffic []TrafficTarget `json:"traffic,omitempty"`
	// URL holds the url that will distribute traffic over the provided traffic targets. It generally has the form: https://{route-hash}-{project-hash}-{cluster-level-suffix}.a.run.app
	URL *string `json:"url,omitempty"`
