// DestinyEntitiesProfilesDestinyProfileComponentUserInfo - This contract supplies basic information commonly used to display a minimal amount of information about a user. Take care to not add more properties here unless the property applies in all (or at least the majority) of the situations where UserInfoCard is used. Avoid adding game specific or platform specific details here. In cases where UserInfoCard is a subset of the data needed in a contract, use UserInfoCard as a property of other contracts.

	//  It turns out that Stadia Pro subscriptions will give access to seasons but only while playing on Stadia and with an active subscription. So some users (users who have Stadia Pro but choose to play on some other platform) won't see these as available: it will be whatever seasons are available for the platform on which they last played.

	//  IMPORTANT: This field may not return the data you're interested in for Cross-Saved users. It returns the last ownership data we saw for this account - which is to say, what they've purchased on the platform on which they last played, which now could be a different platform.
	//  If you don't care about per-platform ownership and only care about whatever platform it seems they are playing on most recently, then this should be "good enough." Otherwise, this should be considered deprecated. We do not have a good alternative to provide at this time with platform specific ownership data for DLC.
