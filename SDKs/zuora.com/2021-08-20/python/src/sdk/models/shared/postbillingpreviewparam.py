    Set one of the following values in this field to decide how the assumption is applied in the billing preview.
    
      * **All:** The assumption is applied to all the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.
      
      * **None:** (Default) The assumption is not applied to the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data based on the current term end date and the target date.
      
        * If the target date is later than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date.
    
        * If the target date is earlier than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.
