 * Service - A Service resource is a logical component of an application that can share state and communicate in a secure fashion with other services. For example, an application that handles customer requests might include separate services to handle tasks such as backend data analysis or API requests from mobile devices. Each service has a collection of versions that define a specific set of code used to implement the functionality of that service.

The labels can be used to search and group resources, and are propagated to the usage and billing reports, enabling fine-grain analysis of costs. An example of using labels is to tag resources belonging to different environments (e.g., "env=prod", "env=qa"). Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, dashes, and international characters. Label keys must start with a lowercase letter or an international character. Each service can have at most 32 labels.
