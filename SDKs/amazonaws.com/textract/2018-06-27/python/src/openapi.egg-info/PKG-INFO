## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `analyze_document` - <p>Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items. </p> <p>The types of information returned are as follows: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two <a>Block</a> objects, each of type <code>KEY_VALUE_SET</code>: a KEY <code>Block</code> object and a VALUE <code>Block</code> object. For example, <i>Name: Ana Silva Carolina</i> contains a key and value. <i>Name:</i> is the key. <i>Ana Silva Carolina</i> is the value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Table and table cell data. A TABLE <code>Block</code> object contains information about a detected table. A CELL <code>Block</code> object is returned for each cell in a table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lines and words of text. A LINE <code>Block</code> object contains one or more WORD <code>Block</code> objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of <code>FeatureTypes</code>). </p> </li> <li> <p>Signatures. A SIGNATURE <code>Block</code> object contains the location information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT <code>Block</code> object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.</p> <p>You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the <code>FeatureTypes</code> list. </p> <p>The output is returned in a list of <code>Block</code> objects.</p> <p> <code>AnalyzeDocument</code> is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use <a>StartDocumentAnalysis</a>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-analyzing.html">Document Text Analysis</a>.</p>
* `analyze_expense` - <p> <code>AnalyzeExpense</code> synchronously analyzes an input document for financially related relationships between text.</p> <p>Information is returned as <code>ExpenseDocuments</code> and seperated as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>LineItemGroups</code>- A data set containing <code>LineItems</code> which store information about the lines of text, such as an item purchased and its price on a receipt.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SummaryFields</code>- Contains all other information a receipt, such as header information or the vendors name.</p> </li> </ul>
* `analyze_id` - Analyzes identity documents for relevant information. This information is extracted and returned as <code>IdentityDocumentFields</code>, which records both the normalized field and value of the extracted text. Unlike other Amazon Textract operations, <code>AnalyzeID</code> doesn't return any Geometry data.
* `detect_document_text` - <p>Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must be in one of the following image formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF, or TIFF. <code>DetectDocumentText</code> returns the detected text in an array of <a>Block</a> objects. </p> <p>Each document page has as an associated <code>Block</code> of type PAGE. Each PAGE <code>Block</code> object is the parent of LINE <code>Block</code> objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE <code>Block</code> object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by <code>Block</code> objects of type WORD.</p> <p> <code>DetectDocumentText</code> is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use <a>StartDocumentTextDetection</a>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-detecting.html">Document Text Detection</a>.</p>
* `get_document_analysis` - <p>Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes text in a document.</p> <p>You start asynchronous text analysis by calling <a>StartDocumentAnalysis</a>, which returns a job identifier (<code>JobId</code>). When the text analysis operation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to <code>StartDocumentAnalysis</code>. To get the results of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is <code>SUCCEEDED</code>. If so, call <code>GetDocumentAnalysis</code>, and pass the job identifier (<code>JobId</code>) from the initial call to <code>StartDocumentAnalysis</code>.</p> <p> <code>GetDocumentAnalysis</code> returns an array of <a>Block</a> objects. The following types of information are returned: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two <a>Block</a> objects, each of type <code>KEY_VALUE_SET</code>: a KEY <code>Block</code> object and a VALUE <code>Block</code> object. For example, <i>Name: Ana Silva Carolina</i> contains a key and value. <i>Name:</i> is the key. <i>Ana Silva Carolina</i> is the value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Table and table cell data. A TABLE <code>Block</code> object contains information about a detected table. A CELL <code>Block</code> object is returned for each cell in a table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lines and words of text. A LINE <code>Block</code> object contains one or more WORD <code>Block</code> objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of the <code>StartDocumentAnalysis</code> <code>FeatureTypes</code> input parameter). </p> </li> <li> <p>Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query Results. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>While processing a document with queries, look out for <code>INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETERS</code> output. This indicates that either the per page query limit has been exceeded or that the operation is trying to query a page in the document which doesnâ€™t exist. </p> </note> <p>Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT <code>Block</code> object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.</p> <p>Use the <code>MaxResults</code> parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are more results than specified in <code>MaxResults</code>, the value of <code>NextToken</code> in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call <code>GetDocumentAnalysis</code>, and populate the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to <code>GetDocumentAnalysis</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-analyzing.html">Document Text Analysis</a>.</p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
