// RegionOfInterest - <p>Specifies a location within the frame that Rekognition checks for objects of interest such as text, labels, or faces. It uses a <code>BoundingBox</code> or <code>Polygon</code> to set a region of the screen.</p> <p>A word, face, or label is included in the region if it is more than half in that region. If there is more than one region, the word, face, or label is compared with all regions of the screen. Any object of interest that is more than half in a region is kept in the results.</p>
