// ResponseHeadersPolicyServerTimingHeadersConfig - <p>A configuration for enabling the <code>Server-Timing</code> header in HTTP responses sent from CloudFront. CloudFront adds this header to HTTP responses that it sends in response to requests that match a cache behavior that's associated with this response headers policy.</p> <p>You can use the <code>Server-Timing</code> header to view metrics that can help you gain insights about the behavior and performance of CloudFront. For example, you can see which cache layer served a cache hit, or the first byte latency from the origin when there was a cache miss. You can use the metrics in the <code>Server-Timing</code> header to troubleshoot issues or test the efficiency of your CloudFront configuration. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/understanding-response-headers-policies.html#server-timing-header">Server-Timing header</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
