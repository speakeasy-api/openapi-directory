### [SDK](docs/sdk/README.md)

* [DescribeAcceleratorOfferings](docs/sdk/README.md#describeacceleratorofferings) - <p> Describes the locations in which a given accelerator type or set of types is present in a given region. </p> <p> February 15, 2023: Starting April 15, 2023, AWS will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. </p>
* [DescribeAcceleratorTypes](docs/sdk/README.md#describeacceleratortypes) - <p> Describes the accelerator types available in a given region, as well as their characteristics, such as memory and throughput. </p> <p> February 15, 2023: Starting April 15, 2023, AWS will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
