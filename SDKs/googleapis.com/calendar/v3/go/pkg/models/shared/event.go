	// Note that the iCalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same iCalUIDs. To retrieve an event using its iCalUID, call the events.list method using the iCalUID parameter. To retrieve an event using its id, call the events.get method.
	ICalUID *string `json:"iCalUID,omitempty"`
	// Opaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs. Provided IDs must follow these rules:
	// - characters allowed in the ID are those used in base32hex encoding, i.e. lowercase letters a-v and digits 0-9, see section 3.1.2 in RFC2938
	// - the length of the ID must be between 5 and 1024 characters
	// - the ID must be unique per calendar  Due to the globally distributed nature of the system, we cannot guarantee that ID collisions will be detected at event creation time. To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.
	// If you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.
	// Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.
	ID *string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Type of the resource ("calendar#event").
	Kind *string `json:"kind,omitempty"`
	// Geographic location of the event as free-form text. Optional.

	// Whether this is a locked event copy where no changes can be made to the main event fields "summary", "description", "location", "start", "end" or "recurrence". The default is False. Read-Only.
	Locked *bool `json:"locked,omitempty"`
	// The organizer of the event. If the organizer is also an attendee, this is indicated with a separate entry in attendees with the organizer field set to True. To change the organizer, use the move operation. Read-only, except when importing an event.
	Organizer         *EventOrganizer `json:"organizer,omitempty"`
	OriginalStartTime *EventDateTime  `json:"originalStartTime,omitempty"`
	// If set to True, Event propagation is disabled. Note that it is not the same thing as Private event properties. Optional. Immutable. The default is False.
	PrivateCopy *bool `json:"privateCopy,omitempty"`
	// List of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.

	Source *EventSource   `json:"source,omitempty"`
	Start  *EventDateTime `json:"start,omitempty"`
	// Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:
	// - "confirmed" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.
	// - "tentative" - The event is tentatively confirmed.
	// - "cancelled" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.
	// A cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:
	// - Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.
	// Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.
	// - All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.
	// Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.
	// If an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.
	Status *string `json:"status,omitempty"`
	// Title of the event.
	Summary *string `json:"summary,omitempty"`
	// Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:
	// - "opaque" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.
	// - "transparent" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.
	Transparency *string `json:"transparency,omitempty"`
	// Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.
	Updated *time.Time `json:"updated,omitempty"`
	// Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:
	// - "default" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.
	// - "public" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.
	// - "private" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.
	// - "confidential" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.
	Visibility                *string                         `json:"visibility,omitempty"`
	WorkingLocationProperties *EventWorkingLocationProperties `json:"workingLocationProperties,omitempty"`
