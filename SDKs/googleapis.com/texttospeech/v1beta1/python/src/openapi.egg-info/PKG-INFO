## Available Resources and Operations


### projects

* `texttospeech_projects_locations_operations_get` - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
* `texttospeech_projects_locations_operations_list` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `texttospeech_projects_locations_synthesize_long_audio` - Synthesizes long form text asynchronously.

### text

* `texttospeech_text_synthesize` - Synthesizes speech synchronously: receive results after all text input has been processed.

### voices

* `texttospeech_voices_list` - Returns a list of Voice supported for synthesis.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
