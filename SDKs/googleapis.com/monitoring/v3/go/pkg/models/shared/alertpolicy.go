	Combiner *AlertPolicyCombinerEnum `json:"combiner,omitempty"`
	// A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six conditions. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, it must be the only condition.

	CreationRecord *MutationRecord `json:"creationRecord,omitempty"`
	// A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.

	// A content string and a MIME type that describes the content string's format.
	Documentation *Documentation `json:"documentation,omitempty"`
	// Whether or not the policy is enabled. On write, the default interpretation if unset is that the policy is enabled. On read, clients should not make any assumption about the state if it has not been populated. The field should always be populated on List and Get operations, unless a field projection has been specified that strips it out.

	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are returned from the ListNotificationChannels method.

Keys must begin with a letter.

	// The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
