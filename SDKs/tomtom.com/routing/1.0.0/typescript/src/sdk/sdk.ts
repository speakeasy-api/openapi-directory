 * <b>Calculate Route</b>
 * Calculates a route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints (if specified). Additional routing parameters like traffic, avoidance conditions, departure/arrival time etc. can be taken into account.
 * <b>Calculate Reachable Range</b>
 * Calculates a set of locations that can be reached from the origin point, subject to the available fuel or energy budget that is specified in the request.
