/**
 * <p>Specifies which Amazon Web Services resource types Config records for configuration changes. In the recording group, you specify whether you want to record all supported resource types or only specific types of resources.</p> <p>By default, Config records the configuration changes for all supported types of <i>regional resources</i> that Config discovers in the region in which it is running. Regional resources are tied to a region and can be used only in that region. Examples of regional resources are EC2 instances and EBS volumes.</p> <p>You can also have Config record supported types of <i>global resources</i>. Global resources are not tied to a specific region and can be used in all regions. The global resource types that Config supports include IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies.</p> <important> <p>Global resource types onboarded to Config recording after February 2022 will only be recorded in the service's home region for the commercial partition and Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) West for the GovCloud partition. You can view the Configuration Items for these new global resource types only in their home region and Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) West.</p> <p>Supported global resource types onboarded before February 2022 such as <code>AWS::IAM::Group</code>, <code>AWS::IAM::Policy</code>, <code>AWS::IAM::Role</code>, <code>AWS::IAM::User</code> remain unchanged, and they will continue to deliver Configuration Items in all supported regions in Config. The change will only affect new global resource types onboarded after February 2022.</p> <p>To record global resource types onboarded after February 2022, enable All Supported Resource Types in the home region of the global resource type you want to record.</p> </important> <p>If you don't want Config to record all resources, you can specify which types of resources it will record with the <code>resourceTypes</code> parameter.</p> <p>For a list of supported resource types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported Resource Types</a>.</p> <p>For more information and a table of the Home Regions for Global Resource Types Onboarded after February 2022, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html">Selecting Which Resources Config Records</a>.</p>
