Multiple policies may be created as follows: <ul><li><b>Product Compliance</b>: a maximum of 10 policies per eBay marketplace may be created</li> <li><b>Takeback</b>: a maximum of 3 policies per eBay marketplace may be created</li></ul>A successful create policy call returns an HTTP status code of <b>201 Created</b> with the system-generated policy ID included in the <b>Location</b> response header.<br/><br/><b>Product Compliance Policy</b><br/><br/>Product Compliance policies disclose product information as required for regulatory compliance.<br/><br/><span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> A maximum of 10 Product Compliance policies per eBay marketplace may be created.</span> <br/><br/> <b>Takeback Policy</b><br/><br/>Takeback policies describe the seller's legal obligation to take back a previously purchased item when the buyer purchases a new one.<br/><br/><span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> A maximum of 3 Takeback policies per eBay marketplace may be created.</span>

The existing <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> values, as they are defined in the current policy, must also be passed in. <br/><br/>A successful policy update call returns an HTTP status code of <b>204 No Content</b>.<br/><br/><span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> The following eBay marketplaces support Custom Policies: <ul><li>Germany (EBAY_DE)</li> <li>Canada (EBAY_CA)</li> <li>Australia (EBAY_AU)</li> <li>United States (EBAY_US)</li> <li>France (EBAY_FR)</li></ul></span><br/><br/>For details on header values, see <a href="/api-docs/static/rest-request-components.html#HTTP">HTTP request headers</a>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
