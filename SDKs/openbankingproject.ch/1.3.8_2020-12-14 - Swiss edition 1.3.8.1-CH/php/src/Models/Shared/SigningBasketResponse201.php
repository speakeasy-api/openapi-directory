     * A list of hyperlinks to be recognised by the TPP. The actual hyperlinks used in the
     * 
     * response depend on the dynamical decisions of the ASPSP when processing the request.
     * 
     * Remark: All links can be relative or full links, to be decided by the ASPSP.
     * Type of links admitted in this response, (further links might be added for ASPSP defined
     * extensions):
     * 
     *   * 'scaRedirect':
     *     In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link to
     *     which to redirect the PSU browser.
     *   * 'scaOAuth':
     *     In case of a SCA OAuth2 Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the URI where the configuration of
     *     the Authorisation Server can be retrieved. The configuration follows the
     *     OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Server Metadata specification.
     *   * 'startAuthorisation':
     *     In case, where an explicit start of the transaction authorisation is needed,
     *     but no more data needs to be updated (no authentication method to be selected,
     *     no PSU identification nor PSU authentication data to be uploaded).
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource
     *     has to be generated while uploading the PSU identification data.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource
     *     has to be generated while uploading the PSU authentication data.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has
     *     to be generated while uploading the encrypted PSU authentication data.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthenticationMethodSelection':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource
     *     has to be generated while selecting the authentication method.
     *     This link is contained under exactly the same conditions as the data element 'scaMethods'
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithTransactionAuthorisation':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource
     *     has to be generated while authorising the transaction e.g. by uploading an
     *     OTP received by SMS.
     *   * 'self':
     *     The link to the payment initiation resource created by this request.
     *     This link can be used to retrieve the resource data.
     *   * 'status':
     *     The link to retrieve the transaction status of the payment initiation.
     *   * 'scaStatus':
     *     The link to retrieve the scaStatus of the corresponding authorisation sub-resource.
     *     This link is only contained, if an authorisation sub-resource has been already created.
