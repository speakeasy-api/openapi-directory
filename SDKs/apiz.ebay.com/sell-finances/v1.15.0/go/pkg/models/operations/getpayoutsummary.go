	// The two filter types that can be used here are discussed below. One or both of these filter types can be used. If none of these filters are used, the data returned in the response will reflect payouts, in all states, processed within the last 90 days. <ul><li><b>payoutDate</b>: consider payouts processed within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is <code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ</code>. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout_summary?filter=payoutDate:[2018-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2018-12-24T00:00:01.000Z]</code><br><br>Alternatively, the user could omit the ending date, and the date range would include the starting date and up to 90 days past that date, or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past.</li> <li><b>payoutStatus</b>: consider only the payouts in a particular state. Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. The supported <b>payoutStatus</b> values are as follows:<ul><li><code>INITIATED</code>: search for payouts that have been initiated but not processed.</li><li><code>SUCCEEDED</code>: consider only successful payouts.</li><li><code>RETRYABLE_FAILED</code>: consider only payouts that failed, but ones which will be tried again.</li><li><code>TERMINAL_FAILED</code>: consider only payouts that failed, and ones that will not be tried again.</li><li> <code>REVERSED</code>: consider only payouts that were reversed. </li></ul>Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payout status: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout_summary?filter=payoutStatus:{SUCCEEDED}</code></ul><br>If both the <b>payoutDate</b> and <b>payoutStatus</b> filters are used, only the payouts that satisfy both criteria are considered in the results.
