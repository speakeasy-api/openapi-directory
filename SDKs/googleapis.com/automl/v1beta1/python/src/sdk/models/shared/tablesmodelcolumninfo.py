A value between 0 and 1, higher means higher influence. These values are normalized - for all input feature columns of a given model they add to 1. When given back by Predict (populated iff feature_importance param is set) or Batch Predict (populated iff feature_importance param is set): Measurement of how impactful for the prediction returned for the given row the value in this column was. Specifically, the feature importance specifies the marginal contribution that the feature made to the prediction score compared to the baseline score. These values are computed using the Sampled Shapley method."""
