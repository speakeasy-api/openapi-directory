// DateOperatorOptions - Optional. Provides a search operator for date properties. Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields relevant to the type of item being searched.
type DateOperatorOptions struct {
	// Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the date property using the greater-than operator. For example, if greaterThanOperatorName is *closedafter* and the property's name is *closeDate*, then queries like *closedafter:<value>* show results only where the value of the property named *closeDate* is later than *<value>*. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters.
	GreaterThanOperatorName *string `json:"greaterThanOperatorName,omitempty"`
	// Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the date property using the less-than operator. For example, if lessThanOperatorName is *closedbefore* and the property's name is *closeDate*, then queries like *closedbefore:<value>* show results only where the value of the property named *closeDate* is earlier than *<value>*. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters.
	LessThanOperatorName *string `json:"lessThanOperatorName,omitempty"`
	// Indicates the actual string required in the query in order to isolate the date property. For example, suppose an issue tracking schema object has a property named *closeDate* that specifies an operator with an operatorName of *closedon*. For searches on that data, queries like *closedon:<value>* show results only where the value of the *closeDate* property matches *<value>*. By contrast, a search that uses the same *<value>* without an operator returns all items where *<value>* matches the value of any String properties or text within the content field for the indexed datasource. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters.
	OperatorName *string `json:"operatorName,omitempty"`
