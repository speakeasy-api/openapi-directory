### publications

* `readerrevenuesubscriptionlinkingPublicationsReadersDelete` - Removes a publication reader, effectively severing the association with a Google user. If `force` is set to true, any entitlements for this reader will also be deleted. (Otherwise, the request will only work if the reader has no entitlements.) - If the reader does not exist, return NOT_FOUND. - Return FAILED_PRECONDITION if the force field is false (or unset) and entitlements are present.
* `readerrevenuesubscriptionlinkingPublicationsReadersGetEntitlements` - Gets the reader entitlements for a publication reader. - Returns PERMISSION_DENIED if the caller does not have access. - Returns NOT_FOUND if the reader does not exist.
* `readerrevenuesubscriptionlinkingPublicationsReadersUpdateEntitlements` - Updates the reader entitlements for a publication reader. The entire reader entitlements will be overwritten by the new reader entitlements in the payload, like a PUT. - Returns PERMISSION_DENIED if the caller does not have access. - Returns NOT_FOUND if the reader does not exist.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
