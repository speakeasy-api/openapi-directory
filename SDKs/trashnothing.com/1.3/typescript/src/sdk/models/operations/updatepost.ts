   * When the post should expire.   Any amount of time from 1 hour to 90 days can be provided.  To pass a number of hours, provide the number of hours prefixed by 'h' (eg. 1hr 24hr). To pass a number of days, provide the number of days prefixed by 'd' (eg. 1d 90d). <br /><br /> Note that updates may not appear instantly after submission because the volunteer moderators of many groups may have additional automatic or manual review processes in place that can cause delays.  So with short expirations (eg. < 8 hours), there is a chance that the post may expire before the update is approved and so it will never be published.

   * @remarks
