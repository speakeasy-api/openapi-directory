// LogMatch - A condition type that checks whether a log message in the scoping project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) satisfies the given filter. Logs from other projects in the metrics scope are not evaluated.
type LogMatch struct {
	// Required. A logs-based filter. See Advanced Logs Queries (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) for how this filter should be constructed.
	Filter *string `json:"filter,omitempty"`
	// Optional. A map from a label key to an extractor expression, which is used to extract the value for this label key. Each entry in this map is a specification for how data should be extracted from log entries that match filter. Each combination of extracted values is treated as a separate rule for the purposes of triggering notifications. Label keys and corresponding values can be used in notifications generated by this condition.Please see the documentation on logs-based metric valueExtractors (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.metrics#LogMetric.FIELDS.value_extractor) for syntax and examples.
