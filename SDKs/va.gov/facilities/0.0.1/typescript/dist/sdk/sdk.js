/**
 * ## Background
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * This RESTful API provides information about physical VA facilities. Information available includes
 * geographic location, address, phone, hours of operation, and available services.
 *
 * VA operates several different types of facilities, the types represented in this API include:
 * - Health Facilities (vha)
 * - Benefits Facilities (vba)
 * - Cemeteries (nca)
 * - Vet Centers (vc)
 *
 * To read an FAQ on how wait times are calculated, click the "For more information" link on [this page](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/PWT/SearchWaitTimes).
 *
 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * ### Base URLs
 *
 * The base URLs for the VA Facilities API in the various environments are:
 * - Sandbox: `https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0`
 * - Production: `https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0`
 *
 * ### Authorization
 *
 * API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`.
 *
 * ### Response Formats
 *
 * Clients may request several response formats by setting the `Accept` header.
 * - `application/json` - The default JSON response format complies with JSON API. This media type is *not* available for bulk requests using the `/facilities/all` endpoint. It will return `406 Not Acceptable`.
 * - `application/geo+json` - GeoJSON-compliant format, representing each facility as a feature with a point geometry.
 * - `application/vnd.geo+json` - Deprecated. Prefer application/geo+json.
 * - `text/csv` - Available for the bulk download operation only. Some structured fields are omitted from the CSV response.
 *
 * ### Response Elements
 *
 * Some data elements within the response are only present for facilities of a given type:
 * - The patient satisfaction scores contained in the `satisfaction` element are only applicable
 *   to VA health facilities.
 * - The patient wait time values contained in the `wait_times` element are only applicable to
 *   VA health facilities.
 * - The list of available services in the `services` element is only applicable to VA health and
 *   benefits facilities.
 * - The operational hours special instructions contained in the `operational_hours_special_instructions` element is only applicable to VA health and Vet Center facilities.
 *
 * ### Facility ID Formats and Constraints
 *
 * A facility ID has the format `prefix_stationNumber`. The prefix is one of nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be national (VA) or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an `s`. There are no other constraints on the format. Examples:
 * - Health: `vha_402GA`
 * - Benefits: `vba_539GB`
 * - National cemetery: `nca_063`
 * - Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082`
 * - Vet center: `vc_0872MVC`
 *
 *
 * ### Mobile Facilities
 *
 * The mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with `"mobile": "true"`, the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.
 *
 * ## Deprecations
 *
 * - `active_status` field is deprecated and replaced with `operating_status`.
 * - `application/vnd.geo+json` media type is deprecated and replaced by `application/geo+json`
 *
 *
 * ## Reference
 *
 * - [Raw VA Facilities Open API Spec](https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/docs/v0/api)
 * - [GeoJSON Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946)
 * - [JSON API Format](https://jsonapi.org/format/)
