/** <p>Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock time of the media.</p> <p>The default is <code>NEVER</code>. When <a>HLSFragmentSelector</a> is <code>SERVER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when <a>HLSFragmentSelector</a> is <code>PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps. </p> */
