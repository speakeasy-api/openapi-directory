	// The KeySchema identifies the primary key as a one attribute primary key (hash) or a composite two attribute (hash-and-range) primary key. Single attribute primary keys have one index value: a <code>HashKeyElement</code>. A composite hash-and-range primary key contains two attribute values: a <code>HashKeyElement</code> and a <code>RangeKeyElement</code>.

	// Provisioned throughput reserves the required read and write resources for your table in terms of <code>ReadCapacityUnits</code> and <code>WriteCapacityUnits</code>. Values for provisioned throughput depend upon your expected read/write rates, item size, and consistency. Provide the expected number of read and write operations, assuming an item size of 1k and strictly consistent reads. For 2k item size, double the value. For 3k, triple the value, etc. Eventually-consistent reads consume half the resources of strictly consistent reads.
