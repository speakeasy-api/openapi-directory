Refer to [Cloud Speech API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/basics#select-model) for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search (best for very short utterances and commands)
