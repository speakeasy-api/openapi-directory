## Available Resources and Operations


### rateLimit

* `getRateLimits` - This method retrieves the call limit and utilization data for an application. The data is retrieved for all RESTful APIs and the legacy Trading API.  <br><br>The response from <b>getRateLimits</b> includes a list of the applicable resources and the "call limit", or quota, that is set for each resource. In addition to quota information, the response also includes the number of remaining calls available before the limit is reached, the time remaining before the quota resets, and the length of the "time window" to which the quota applies.  <br><br>By default, this method returns utilization data for all RESTful API and the legacy Trading API resources. Use the <b>api_name</b> and <b>api_context</b> query parameters to filter the response to only the desired APIs.  <br><br>For more on call limits, see <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/support/app-check " target="_blank">Compatible Application Check</a>.

### userRateLimit

* `getUserRateLimits` - This method retrieves the call limit and utilization data for an application user. The call-limit data is returned for all RESTful APIs and the legacy Trading API that limit calls on a per-user basis.  <br><br>The response from <b>getUserRateLimits</b> includes a list of the applicable resources and the "call limit", or quota, that is set for each resource. In addition to quota information, the response also includes the number of remaining calls available before the limit is reached, the time remaining before the quota resets, and the length of the "time window" to which the quota applies.  <br><br>By default, this method returns utilization data for all RESTful APIs resources and the legacy Trading API calls that limit request access by user. Use the <b>api_name</b> and <b>api_context</b> query parameters to filter the response to only the desired APIs.  <br><br>For more on call limits, see <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/support/app-check " target="_blank">Compatible Application Check</a>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage 
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally 
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
