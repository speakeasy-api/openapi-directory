## Available Resources and Operations


### Projects

* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsWorkerPoolsCreate` - Creates a `WorkerPool` to run the builds, and returns the new worker pool. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.
* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsWorkerPoolsDelete` - Deletes a `WorkerPool`. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.
* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsWorkerPoolsGet` - Returns details of a `WorkerPool`.
* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsWorkerPoolsList` - Lists `WorkerPool`s in the given project.
* `CloudbuildProjectsLocationsWorkerPoolsPatch` - Updates a `WorkerPool`. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
