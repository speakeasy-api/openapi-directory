// InsertDimensionRequest - Inserts rows or columns in a sheet at a particular index.
type InsertDimensionRequest struct {
	// Whether dimension properties should be extended from the dimensions before or after the newly inserted dimensions. True to inherit from the dimensions before (in which case the start index must be greater than 0), and false to inherit from the dimensions after. For example, if row index 0 has red background and row index 1 has a green background, then inserting 2 rows at index 1 can inherit either the green or red background. If `inheritFromBefore` is true, the two new rows will be red (because the row before the insertion point was red), whereas if `inheritFromBefore` is false, the two new rows will be green (because the row after the insertion point was green).
	InheritFromBefore *bool `json:"inheritFromBefore,omitempty"`
	// A range along a single dimension on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open: the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.
	Range *DimensionRange `json:"range,omitempty"`
