  /**
   * A field name of the form `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/fields/{field_path}` A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. `address` or a path to fields within map_value , e.g. `address.city`, or a special field path. The only valid special field is `*`, which represents any field. Field paths may be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: `*`, `.`, ``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `\`address.city\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `\`*\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field. A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields. This field's resource name is: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*` Indexes defined on this `Field` will be applied to all fields which do not have their own `Field` index configuration.
