// RotateChallengesRequestInput - The request message for the RotateChallenges RPC. Requires an access token, a root domain, and either records_to_add or records_to_remove to be populated. Records may be set for multiple subdomains at once to support SAN requests for multiple subdomains in a single domain. By default, ACME TXT record challenges that are older than 30 days will be removed. Set `keep_expired_records` to false if this behavior is undesired. There is a record maximum of 100 records per domain including expired records. Any request sent that would exceed this maximum will result in a FAILED_PRECONDITION error. NEXT ID: 6
