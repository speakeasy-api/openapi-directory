## Available Resources and Operations


### [assets](docs/assets/README.md)

* [polyAssetsGet](docs/assets/README.md#polyassetsget) - Returns detailed information about an asset given its name. PRIVATE assets are returned only if the currently authenticated user (via OAuth token) is the author of the asset.
* [polyAssetsList](docs/assets/README.md#polyassetslist) - Lists all public, remixable assets. These are assets with an access level of PUBLIC and published under the CC-By license.

### [users](docs/users/README.md)

* [polyUsersAssetsList](docs/users/README.md#polyusersassetslist) - Lists assets authored by the given user. Only the value 'me', representing the currently-authenticated user, is supported. May include assets with an access level of PRIVATE or UNLISTED and assets which are All Rights Reserved for the currently-authenticated user.
* [polyUsersLikedassetsList](docs/users/README.md#polyuserslikedassetslist) - Lists assets that the user has liked. Only the value 'me', representing the currently-authenticated user, is supported. May include assets with an access level of UNLISTED.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
