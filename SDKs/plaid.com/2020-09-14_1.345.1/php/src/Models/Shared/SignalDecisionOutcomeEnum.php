 * `APPROVE`: approve the transaction without requiring further actions from your customers.

 * 
 * `REVIEW`: the transaction requires manual review
 * 
 * `REJECT`: reject the transaction
 * 
 * `TAKE_OTHER_RISK_MEASURES`: for example, placing a longer hold on funds than those approved transactions or introducing customer frictions such as step-up verification/authentication
 * 
 * `NOT_EVALUATED`: if only logging the Signal results without using them
 * 
 * Possible values:  `APPROVE`, `REVIEW`, `REJECT`, `TAKE_OTHER_RISK_MEASURES`, `NOT_EVALUATED`
