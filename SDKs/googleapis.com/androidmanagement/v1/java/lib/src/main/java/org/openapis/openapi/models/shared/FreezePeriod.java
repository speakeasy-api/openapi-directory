/**
 * FreezePeriod - A system freeze period. When a device\u2019s clock is within the freeze period, all incoming system updates (including security patches) are blocked and won\u2019t be installed. When a device is outside the freeze period, normal update behavior applies. Leap years are ignored in freeze period calculations, in particular: * If Feb. 29th is set as the start or end date of a freeze period, the freeze period will start or end on Feb. 28th instead. * When a device\u2019s system clock reads Feb. 29th, it\u2019s treated as Feb. 28th. * When calculating the number of days in a freeze period or the time between two freeze periods, Feb. 29th is ignored and not counted as a day.Note: For Freeze Periods to take effect, SystemUpdateType cannot be specified as SYSTEM_UPDATE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, because freeze periods require a defined policy to be specified.
