 * GroupLicensePermissionsEnum - The permission approval status of the product. This field is only set if the product is approved.

No additional product licenses can be assigned until the product is reapproved, - "allCurrentAndFutureApproved", the current permissions are approved and any future permission updates will be automatically approved without administrator review.
