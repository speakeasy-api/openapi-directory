/**
 * Tag - &lt;p&gt;An object that defines the tags associated with an application. A &lt;i&gt;tag&lt;/i&gt; is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each tag consists of a required &lt;i&gt;tag key&lt;/i&gt; and an associated &lt;i&gt;tag value&lt;/i&gt;, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tag keys and values are case sensitive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;aws:&lt;/code&gt; prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can\u2019t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
