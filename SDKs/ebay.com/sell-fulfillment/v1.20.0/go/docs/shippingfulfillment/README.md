Although these components might be provided by the manufacturer in separate packaging, the seller must include all components of a given line item in the same package.</span> <br><br>Before using this call for a given package, you must determine which line items are in the package.

## GetShippingFulfillments

Use this call to retrieve the contents of all fulfillments currently defined for a specified order based on the order's unique identifier, <b>orderId</b>.
