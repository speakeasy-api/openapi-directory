    /**
     * createReportTask - This method creates a report task, which generates a Promoted Listings report based on the values specified in the call. The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the attributes of the data included in the reports. When creating a report task, you can specify the items you want included in the report. The items you specify, using either listingId or inventoryReference values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report. For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see Creating Promoted Listings reports. This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of .tsv.gz. Note: This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type. Fields not supported by the specified report type are ignored. Call getReportMetadata to retrieve a list of the fields you need to configure for each Promoted Listings report type.
