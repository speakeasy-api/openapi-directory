   * If a client encounters an unfamiliar or empty type, it should still be able to display the entry points. However, it should disallow modifications.
   * The possible values are:
   * - "eventHangout" for Hangouts for consumers (deprecated; existing events may show this conference solution type but new conferences cannot be created)
   * - "eventNamedHangout" for classic Hangouts for Google Workspace users (deprecated; existing events may show this conference solution type but new conferences cannot be created)
   * - "hangoutsMeet" for Google Meet (http://meet.google.com)
   * - "addOn" for 3P conference providers
