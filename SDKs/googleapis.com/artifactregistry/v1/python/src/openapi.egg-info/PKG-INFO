## Available Resources and Operations


### projects

* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_list` - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_apt_artifacts_import` - Imports Apt artifacts. The returned Operation will complete once the resources are imported. Package, Version, and File resources are created based on the imported artifacts. Imported artifacts that conflict with existing resources are ignored.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_apt_artifacts_upload` - Directly uploads an Apt artifact. The returned Operation will complete once the resources are uploaded. Package, Version, and File resources are created based on the imported artifact. Imported artifacts that conflict with existing resources are ignored.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_create` - Creates a repository. The returned Operation will finish once the repository has been created. Its response will be the created Repository.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_docker_images_list` - Lists docker images.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_files_list` - Lists files.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_get_iam_policy` - Gets the IAM policy for a given resource.
* `artifactregistry_projects_locations_repositories_kfp_artifacts_upload` - Directly uploads a KFP artifact. The returned Operation will complete once the resource is uploaded. Package, Version, and File resources will be created based on the uploaded artifact. Uploaded artifacts that conflict with existing resources will be overwritten.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
