## Overview

The fire.com API allows you to deeply integrate Business Account features into your application or back-office systems.

The API provides read access to your profile, accounts and transactions, event-driven notifications of activity on the account and payment initiation via batches. Each feature has its own HTTP endpoint and every endpoint has its own permission.


The API exposes 3 main areas of functionality: financial functions, service information and service configuration.
## Financial Functions
These functions provide access to your account details, transactions, payee accounts, payment initiation etc.
## Service Functions
These provide information about the fees and limits applied to your account.
