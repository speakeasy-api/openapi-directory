/**
 * **Base API URL**: https://api.configcat.com
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * If you prefer the swagger documentation, you can find it here: [Swagger UI](https://api.configcat.com/swagger).
 *
 * The purpose of this API is to access the ConfigCat platform programmatically.
 * You can **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** any entities like **Feature Flags, Configs, Environments** or **Products** within ConfigCat.
 *
 * The API is based on HTTP REST, uses resource-oriented URLs, status codes and supports JSON
 * and JSON+HAL format. Do not use this API for accessing and evaluating feature flag values. Use the [SDKs instead](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/overview).
 *
 *
 * # OpenAPI Specification
 *
 * The complete specification is publicly available here: [swagger.json](v1/swagger.json).
 * You can use it to generate client libraries in various languages with [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) or
 * [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to interact with this API.
 *
 * # Authentication
 * This API uses the [Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
 *
 * <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->
 *
 * # Throttling and rate limits
 * All the rate limited API calls are returning information about the current rate limit period in the following HTTP headers:
 *
 * | Header | Description |
 * | :- | :- |
 * | X-Rate-Limit-Remaining | The maximum number of requests remaining in the current rate limit period. |
 * | X-Rate-Limit-Reset     | The time	when the current rate limit period resets.						  |
 *
 * When the rate limit is exceeded by a request, the API returns with a `HTTP 429 - Too many requests` status along with a `Retry-After` HTTP header.
