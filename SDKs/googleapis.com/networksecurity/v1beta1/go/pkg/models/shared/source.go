// Source - Specification of traffic source attributes.
type Source struct {
	// Optional. List of CIDR ranges to match based on source IP address. At least one IP block should match. Single IP (e.g., "1.2.3.4") and CIDR (e.g., "1.2.3.0/24") are supported. Authorization based on source IP alone should be avoided. The IP addresses of any load balancers or proxies should be considered untrusted.
	IPBlocks []string `json:"ipBlocks,omitempty"`
	// Optional. List of peer identities to match for authorization. At least one principal should match. Each peer can be an exact match, or a prefix match (example, "namespace/*") or a suffix match (example, "*/service-account") or a presence match "*". Authorization based on the principal name without certificate validation (configured by ServerTlsPolicy resource) is considered insecure.
	Principals []string `json:"principals,omitempty"`
