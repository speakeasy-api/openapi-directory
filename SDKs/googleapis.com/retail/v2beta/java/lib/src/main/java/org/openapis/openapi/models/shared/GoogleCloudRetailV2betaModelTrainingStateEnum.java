 * GoogleCloudRetailV2betaModelTrainingStateEnum - Optional. The training state that the model is in (e.g. `TRAINING` or `PAUSED`). Since part of the cost of running the service is frequency of training - this can be used to determine when to train model in order to control cost. If not specified: the default value for `CreateModel` method is `TRAINING`. The default value for `UpdateModel` method is to keep the state the same as before.
