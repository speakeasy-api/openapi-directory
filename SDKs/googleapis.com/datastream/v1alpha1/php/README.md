## SDK Installation

### Composer

To install the SDK first add the below to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"

### projects

* `datastreamProjectsLocationsConnectionProfilesCreate` - Use this method to create a connection profile in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsConnectionProfilesDiscover` - Use this method to discover a connection profile. The discover API call exposes the data objects and metadata belonging to the profile. Typically, a request returns children data objects under a parent data object that's optionally supplied in the request.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsConnectionProfilesList` - Use this method to list connection profiles created in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsFetchStaticIps` - The FetchStaticIps API call exposes the static IP addresses used by Datastream.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsList` - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsOperationsList` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsPrivateConnectionsCreate` - Use this method to create a private connectivity configuration.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsPrivateConnectionsList` - Use this method to list private connectivity configurations in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsPrivateConnectionsRoutesCreate` - Use this method to create a route for a private connectivity in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsPrivateConnectionsRoutesList` - Use this method to list routes created for a private connectivity in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsCreate` - Use this method to create a stream.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsDelete` - Use this method to delete a stream.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsFetchErrors` - Use this method to fetch any errors associated with a stream.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsList` - Use this method to list streams in a project and location.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsObjectsGet` - Use this method to get details about a stream object.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsObjectsList` - Use this method to list the objects of a specific stream.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsObjectsStartBackfillJob` - Starts backfill job for the specified stream object.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsObjectsStopBackfillJob` - Stops the backfill job for the specified stream object.
* `datastreamProjectsLocationsStreamsPatch` - Use this method to update the configuration of a stream.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
