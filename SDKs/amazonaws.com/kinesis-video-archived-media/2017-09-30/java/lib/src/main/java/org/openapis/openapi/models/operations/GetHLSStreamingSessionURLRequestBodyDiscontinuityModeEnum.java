/**
 * GetHLSStreamingSessionURLRequestBodyDiscontinuityModeEnum - &lt;p&gt;Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added to the media playlists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if &lt;a&gt;HLSFragmentSelector&lt;/a&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;SERVER_TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;), the media player timeline will also have small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played immediately after the previous fragment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following modes are supported:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/code&gt;: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of &lt;code&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/code&gt; if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;NEVER&lt;/code&gt;: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is recommended to use a value of &lt;code&gt;NEVER&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the media player timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;ON_DISCONTINUITY&lt;/code&gt;: a discontinuity marker is placed between fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds. For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of &lt;code&gt;ON_DISCONTINUITY&lt;/code&gt; so that the media player timeline is only reset when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a missing fragment).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The default is &lt;code&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;a&gt;HLSFragmentSelector&lt;/a&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;SERVER_TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;NEVER&lt;/code&gt; when it is set to &lt;code&gt;PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
