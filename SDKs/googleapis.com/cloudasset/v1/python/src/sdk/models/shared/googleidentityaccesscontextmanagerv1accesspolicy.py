For example, a policy with scopes=[\\"folders/123\\"] has the following behavior: - vpcsc perimeters can only restrict projects within folders/123 - access levels can only be referenced by resources within folders/123. If empty, there are no limitations on which resources can be restricted by an ACM policy, and there are no limitations on where ACM resources can be referenced. Only one policy can include a given scope (attempting to create a second policy which includes \\"folders/123\\" will result in an error).
