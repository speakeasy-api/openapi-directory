// ListAvailableLocationsResponse - Successful response
type ListAvailableLocationsResponse struct {
	// One page of results from a call to `ListAvailableLocations`.
	Locations []Location `json:"locations,omitempty"`
	// If the result list is too large to fit in a single response, then a token is returned. If the string is empty, then this response is the last page of results and all available locations have been listed. This token can be used in a subsequent call to `ListAvailableLocations` to find more locations. Page tokens are short-lived and should not be persisted.
