## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `activate_anomaly_detector` - Activates an anomaly detector.
* `back_test_anomaly_detector` - Runs a backtest for anomaly detection for the specified resource.
* `create_alert` - Creates an alert for an anomaly detector.
* `create_anomaly_detector` - Creates an anomaly detector.
* `create_metric_set` - Creates a dataset.
* `deactivate_anomaly_detector` - Deactivates an anomaly detector.
* `delete_alert` - Deletes an alert.
* `delete_anomaly_detector` - Deletes a detector. Deleting an anomaly detector will delete all of its corresponding resources including any configured datasets and alerts.
* `describe_alert` - <p>Describes an alert.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `describe_anomaly_detection_executions` - Returns information about the status of the specified anomaly detection jobs.
* `describe_anomaly_detector` - <p>Describes a detector.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `describe_metric_set` - <p>Describes a dataset.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `detect_metric_set_config` - Detects an Amazon S3 dataset's file format, interval, and offset.
* `get_anomaly_group` - Returns details about a group of anomalous metrics.
* `get_data_quality_metrics` - Returns details about the requested data quality metrics.
* `get_feedback` - Get feedback for an anomaly group.
* `get_sample_data` - Returns a selection of sample records from an Amazon S3 datasource.
* `list_alerts` - <p>Lists the alerts attached to a detector.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `list_anomaly_detectors` - <p>Lists the detectors in the current AWS Region.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `list_anomaly_group_related_metrics` - Returns a list of measures that are potential causes or effects of an anomaly group.
* `list_anomaly_group_summaries` - Returns a list of anomaly groups.
* `list_anomaly_group_time_series` - Gets a list of anomalous metrics for a measure in an anomaly group.
* `list_metric_sets` - <p>Lists the datasets in the current AWS Region.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If you do a read operation on a resource immediately after creating or modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to complete.</p>
* `list_tags_for_resource` - Gets a list of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookoutmetrics/latest/dev/detectors-tags.html">tags</a> for a detector, dataset, or alert.
* `put_feedback` - Add feedback for an anomalous metric.
* `tag_resource` - Adds <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookoutmetrics/latest/dev/detectors-tags.html">tags</a> to a detector, dataset, or alert.
* `untag_resource` - Removes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookoutmetrics/latest/dev/detectors-tags.html">tags</a> from a detector, dataset, or alert.
* `update_alert` - Make changes to an existing alert.
* `update_anomaly_detector` - Updates a detector. After activation, you can only change a detector's ingestion delay and description.
* `update_metric_set` - Updates a dataset.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
