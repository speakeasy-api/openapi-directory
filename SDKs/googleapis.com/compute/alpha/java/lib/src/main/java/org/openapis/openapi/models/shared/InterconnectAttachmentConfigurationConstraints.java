For example, a Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection to a remote cloud provider that requires BGP MD5 authentication has the interconnectRemoteLocation attachment_configuration_constraints.bgp_md5 field set to MD5_REQUIRED, and that property is propagated to the attachment. Similarly, if BGP MD5 is MD5_UNSUPPORTED, an error is returned if MD5 is requested.
