// Error - A container that defines the elements of error and warning messages.
type Error struct {
	// The category type for this error or warning. It is a string that can have one of three values: Application: Indicates an exception or error occurred in the application code or at runtime. Examples include catching an exception in a service's business logic, system failures, or request errors from a dependency. Business: Used when your service or a dependent service refused to continue processing on the resource because of a business rule violation such as &quot;Seller does not ship item to Antarctica&quot; or &quot;Buyer ineligible to purchase an alcoholic item&quot;. Business errors are not syntactical input errors. Request: Used when there is anything wrong with the request, such as authentication, syntactical errors, rate limiting or missing headers, bad HTTP header values, and so on.

	// Name of the domain ,or primary system, of the service or application where the error occurred.
	Domain *string `json:"domain,omitempty"`
	// A positive integer that uniquely identifies the specific error condition that occurred. Your application can use error codes as identifiers in your customized error-handling algorithms.
	ErrorID *int `json:"errorId,omitempty"`
	// Identifies specific request elements associated with the error, if any. inputRefId's response is format specific. For JSON, use JSONPath notation.
	InputRefIds []string `json:"inputRefIds,omitempty"`
	// A more detailed explanation of the error than given in the message error field.
	LongMessage *string `json:"longMessage,omitempty"`
	// Information on how to correct the problem, in the end user's terms and language where applicable. Its value is at most 50 characters long. If applicable, the value is localized in the end user's requested locale.

	// Identifies specific response elements associated with the error, if any. Path format is the same as inputRefId.
	OutputRefIds []string `json:"outputRefIds,omitempty"`
	// This optional list of name/value pairs that contain context-specific ErrorParameter objects, with each item in the list being a parameter (or input field name) that caused an error condition. Each ErrorParameter object consists of two fields, a name and a value.
	Parameters []ErrorParameter `json:"parameters,omitempty"`
