### SDK SDK

* `BatchGetSchema` - Retrieves multiple schemas by their identifiers.
* `CreateCollaboration` - Creates a new collaboration.
* `CreateConfiguredTable` - Creates a new configured table resource.
* `CreateConfiguredTableAnalysisRule` - Creates a new analysis rule for a configured table. Currently, only one analysis rule can be created for a given configured table.
* `CreateConfiguredTableAssociation` - Creates a configured table association. A configured table association links a configured table with a collaboration.
* `CreateMembership` - Creates a membership for a specific collaboration identifier and joins the collaboration.
* `DeleteCollaboration` - Deletes a collaboration. It can only be called by the collaboration owner.
* `DeleteConfiguredTable` - Deletes a configured table.
* `DeleteConfiguredTableAnalysisRule` - Deletes a configured table analysis rule.
* `DeleteConfiguredTableAssociation` - Deletes a configured table association.
* `DeleteMember` - Removes the specified member from a collaboration. The removed member is placed in the Removed status and can't interact with the collaboration. The removed member's data is inaccessible to active members of the collaboration.
* `DeleteMembership` - Deletes a specified membership. All resources under a membership must be deleted.
* `GetCollaboration` - Returns metadata about a collaboration.
* `GetConfiguredTable` - Retrieves a configured table.
* `GetConfiguredTableAnalysisRule` - Retrieves a configured table analysis rule.
* `GetConfiguredTableAssociation` - Retrieves a configured table association.
* `GetMembership` - Retrieves a specified membership for an identifier.
* `GetProtectedQuery` - Returns query processing metadata.
* `GetSchema` - Retrieves the schema for a relation within a collaboration.
* `GetSchemaAnalysisRule` - Retrieves a schema analysis rule.
* `ListCollaborations` - Lists collaborations the caller owns, is active in, or has been invited to.
* `ListConfiguredTableAssociations` - Lists configured table associations for a membership.
* `ListConfiguredTables` - Lists configured tables.
* `ListMembers` - Lists all members within a collaboration.
* `ListMemberships` - Lists all memberships resources within the caller's account.
* `ListProtectedQueries` - Lists protected queries, sorted by the most recent query.
* `ListSchemas` - Lists the schemas for relations within a collaboration.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Lists all of the tags that have been added to a resource.
* `StartProtectedQuery` - Creates a protected query that is started by AWS Clean Rooms.
* `TagResource` - Tags a resource.
* `UntagResource` - Removes a tag or list of tags from a resource.
* `UpdateCollaboration` - Updates collaboration metadata and can only be called by the collaboration owner.
* `UpdateConfiguredTable` - Updates a configured table.
* `UpdateConfiguredTableAnalysisRule` - Updates a configured table analysis rule.
* `UpdateConfiguredTableAssociation` - Updates a configured table association.
* `UpdateMembership` - Updates a membership.
* `UpdateProtectedQuery` - Updates the processing of a currently running query.
