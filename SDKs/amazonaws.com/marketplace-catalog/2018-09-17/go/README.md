## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `CancelChangeSet` - Used to cancel an open change request. Must be sent before the status of the request changes to <code>APPLYING</code>, the final stage of completing your change request. You can describe a change during the 60-day request history retention period for API calls.
* `DescribeChangeSet` - Provides information about a given change set.
* `DescribeEntity` - Returns the metadata and content of the entity.
* `ListChangeSets` - <p>Returns the list of change sets owned by the account being used to make the call. You can filter this list by providing any combination of <code>entityId</code>, <code>ChangeSetName</code>, and status. If you provide more than one filter, the API operation applies a logical AND between the filters.</p> <p>You can describe a change during the 60-day request history retention period for API calls.</p>
* `ListEntities` - Provides the list of entities of a given type.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Lists all tags that have been added to a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).
* `StartChangeSet` - <p>Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single <code>ChangeSet</code>, you can't start the same change type against the same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a <code>ChangeSet</code> is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will receive a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> error.</p> <p>For example, you can't start the <code>ChangeSet</code> described in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples">example</a> later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same change type (<code>AddRevisions</code>) against the same entity (<code>entity-id@1</code>).</p> <p>For more information about working with change sets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets"> Working with change sets</a>.</p>
* `TagResource` - Tags a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).
* `UntagResource` - Removes a tag or list of tags from a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).
