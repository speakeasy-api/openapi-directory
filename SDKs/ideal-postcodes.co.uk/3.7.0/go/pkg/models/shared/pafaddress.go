Normally, the postal county is returned. If this is not present, the county field will fall back to the administrative county. If the administrative county is also not present, the county field will fall back to the traditional county. May be empty in cases where no administrative, postal or traditional county present.

	PoBox string `json:"po_box"`
	// A Post Town is mandatory for delivery of mail to a Delivery Point. This is not necessarily the nearest town geographically, but a routing instruction to the Royal Mail delivery office sorting mail for that Delivery Point. A Post Town will always be present in every address, and for some Localities the Post Town will be the only locality element present.
	PostTown string `json:"post_town"`

	PostcodeOutward string `json:"postcode_outward"`
	// This indicates the type of user. It can only take the values 'S' or 'L' indicating small or large respectively. Large User Postcodes. These are assigned to one single address either due to the large volume of mail received at that address, or because a PO Box or Selectapost service has been set up. Small User Postcodes. These identify a group of Delivery Points.
	//
	// On average there are 15 Delivery Points per Postcode. However this can vary between 1 and, in some cases, 100. There will never be more than 100 Delivery Points on a Postcode.
	PostcodeType PafPostcodeTypeEnum `json:"postcode_type"`
	// A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number, building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail's and can be difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of using our address lines data.
	Premise string `json:"premise"`
	// Small User Organisation Indicator can have the values 'Y' or space. A value of 'Y' indicates that a Small User Organisation is present at this address.
	SuOrganisationIndicator string `json:"su_organisation_indicator"`
	// When a premise is split into individual units such as flats, apartments or business units. Cannot be present without either building_name or building_number. E.g. Flat 1, A, 10B
	SubBuildingName string `json:"sub_building_name"`
	// Also known as the street or road name. In general each Thoroughfare Name will have a separate Postcode. Longer Thoroughfares with high number ranges often have multiple Postcodes covering the entire length of the road, with breaks at suitable points e.g. junctions or natural breaks in the road.
	Thoroughfare string `json:"thoroughfare"`
	// Traditional counties are provided by the Association of British Counties. It is historical data, and can date from the 1800s. May be empty.
	TraditionalCounty string `json:"traditional_county"`
	// UDPRN stands for ‘Unique Delivery Point Reference Number’. Royal Mail assigns a unique UDPRN code for each premise on PAF. Simple, unique reference number for each Delivery Point. Unlikely to be reused when an address expires.
	//
	// Up to 8-digit numeric code.
	//
	// A new UDPRN is automatically assigned to each new Delivery Point added to PAF.
	Udprn int `json:"udprn"`
	// A small minority of individual premises (as identified by a UDPRN) may have multiple occupants behind the same letterbox. These are known as Multiple Residence occupants and can be queried via the Multiple Residence dataset. Simple, unique reference number for each Multiple Residence occupant.
	//
	// Note: this will be an empty string `""` when not used.
	Umprn PafUmprn `json:"umprn"`
	// UPRN stands for Unique Property Reference Number and is maintained by the Ordnance Survey (OS). Local governments in the UK have allocated a unique number for each land or property.
	//
	// Up to 12 digits in length.
	//
	// Multiple Residence premises currently share the same UPRN as the parent premise.
	//
	// May not be available for a small number of Great Britain addresses due to longer update cycles for Ordnance Survey's AddressBase datasets. Returns empty string "" in these instances.
	//
	// Although UPRN takes an integer format, we encode and transmit this data as strings. As a 12 digit number, the UPRN can exceed the maximum safe integer `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` in most browsers causing this datapoint to be corrupted.
	//
	// Take special care when storing UPRN. As a 12 digit identifier, you will need 64 bits to encode every possible UPRN value. This means applications like Excel will corrupt cells containing UPRN values.
	Uprn string `json:"uprn"`
	// The current administrative/electoral area to which the postcode has been assigned. May be empty for a small number of addresses.
	Ward string `json:"ward"`
