   * As a concrete example of this data, the hashes you get for Raids will correspond to the currently active "Challenge Mode".

   * On our side, we don't necessarily even know what these are used for (the game designers know, but we don't), and we have no human readable data for them. In order to use them, you will have to do some experimentation.
