## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `add_notification_channel` - <p> Adds a notification channel to DevOps Guru. A notification channel is used to notify you about important DevOps Guru events, such as when an insight is generated. </p> <p>If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to it notifications. DevOps Guru adds the required policy on your behalf to send notifications using Amazon SNS in your account. DevOps Guru only supports standard SNS topics. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-required-permissions.html">Permissions for cross account Amazon SNS topics</a>.</p> <p>If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to it notifications.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
