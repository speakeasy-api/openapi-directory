type GooglePrivacyDlpV2NumericalStatsResult struct {
	// Set of primitive values supported by the system. Note that for the purposes of inspection or transformation, the number of bytes considered to comprise a 'Value' is based on its representation as a UTF-8 encoded string. For example, if 'integer_value' is set to 123456789, the number of bytes would be counted as 9, even though an int64 only holds up to 8 bytes of data.
