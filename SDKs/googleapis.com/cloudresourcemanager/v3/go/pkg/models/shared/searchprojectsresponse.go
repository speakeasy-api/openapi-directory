// SearchProjectsResponse - A page of the response received from the SearchProjects method. A paginated response where more pages are available has `next_page_token` set. This token can be used in a subsequent request to retrieve the next request page.
type SearchProjectsResponse struct {
	// Pagination token. If the result set is too large to fit in a single response, this token is returned. It encodes the position of the current result cursor. Feeding this value into a new list request with the `page_token` parameter gives the next page of the results. When `next_page_token` is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set. Pagination tokens have a limited lifetime.
	NextPageToken *string `json:"nextPageToken,omitempty"`
	// The list of Projects that matched the list filter query. This list can be paginated.
	Projects []Project `json:"projects,omitempty"`
