	// "following" or "preceding" supported as values.
	// This data attribute defines the behaviour when recurring payment dates falls on a weekend or bank holiday.
	// The payment is then executed either the "preceding" or "following" working day.
	// ASPSP might reject the request due to the communicated value, if rules in Online-Banking are not supporting
	// this execution rule.

	ExecutionRule *ExecutionRuleEnum `json:"executionRule,omitempty"`
	// The following codes from the "EventFrequency7Code" of ISO 20022 are supported:
	// - "Daily"

	// - "EveryTwoWeeks"
	// - "Monthly"
	// - "EveryTwoMonths"
	// - "Quarterly"
	// - "SemiAnnual"

	// The values contained in the array entries shall all be different and the maximum value of one entry is 12.

	//
	MonthsOfExecution []MonthsOfExecutionEnum `json:"monthsOfExecution,omitempty"`
	// This is multiplying the given frequency resulting the exact frequency,
	// e.g. Frequency=weekly and multiplicator=3 means every 3 weeks.
	// Remark: This attribute is rarely supported in the market.

	StartDate types.Date `json:"startDate"`
	// This element is only used in case of frequency equals "Monthly".
	//
	// If this element equals false it has no effect.
	// If this element equals true, then the execution rule is overruled if the day of execution would fall into a different month using the execution rule.
	//
	// Example: executionRule equals "preceding", dayOfExecution equals "02" and the second of a month is a Sunday.
	// In this case, the transaction date would be on the last day of the month before.
	//  This would be overruled if withinAMonthFlag equals true and the payment is processed on Monday the third of the Month.
	// Remark: This attribute is rarely supported in the market.
