// ProjectBillingInfo - Encapsulation of billing information for a Google Cloud Console project. A project has at most one associated billing account at a time (but a billing account can be assigned to multiple projects).
type ProjectBillingInfo struct {
	// The resource name of the billing account associated with the project, if any. For example, `billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF`.
	BillingAccountName *string `json:"billingAccountName,omitempty"`
	// True if the project is associated with an open billing account, to which usage on the project is charged. False if the project is associated with a closed billing account, or no billing account at all, and therefore cannot use paid services. This field is read-only.
	BillingEnabled *bool `json:"billingEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The resource name for the `ProjectBillingInfo`; has the form `projects/{project_id}/billingInfo`. For example, the resource name for the billing information for project `tokyo-rain-123` would be `projects/tokyo-rain-123/billingInfo`. This field is read-only.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the project that this `ProjectBillingInfo` represents, such as `tokyo-rain-123`. This is a convenience field so that you don't need to parse the `name` field to obtain a project ID. This field is read-only.
	ProjectID *string `json:"projectId,omitempty"`
