For display purposes, convert this time into the local time of the seller.  <p>On the date specified, the service derives the keywords for each listing in the campaign, creates an ad for each listing, and associates each new ad with the campaign. The campaign starts after this process is completed. The amount of time it takes the service to start the campaign depends on the number of listings in the campaign. Call <b>getCampaign</b> to check the status of the campaign.</p>
