   * The filtering for items returned from this query request. The format of the filter string is a sequence of expressions, joined by an optional "AND", where each expression is of the form "field operator value". Supported fields: - `time`: Uses numerical operators on date values either in terms of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 or in RFC 3339 format. Examples: - `time > 1452409200000 AND time <= 1492812924310` - `time >= "2016-01-10T01:02:03-05:00"` - `detail.action_detail_case`: Uses the "has" operator (:) and either a singular value or a list of allowed action types enclosed in parentheses, separated by a space. To exclude a result from the response, prepend a hyphen (`-`) to the beginning of the filter string. Examples: - `detail.action_detail_case:RENAME` - `detail.action_detail_case:(CREATE RESTORE)` - `-detail.action_detail_case:MOVE`
