// ServiceAccountDelegationInfo - Identity delegation history of an authenticated service account.
type ServiceAccountDelegationInfo struct {
	// The email address of a Google account.
	PrincipalEmail *string `json:"principalEmail,omitempty"`
	// A string representing the principal_subject associated with the identity. As compared to `principal_email`, supports principals that aren't associated with email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities, the format will be `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subjects/{subject}` except for some GKE identities (GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM, GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD) that are still in the legacy format `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`
	PrincipalSubject *string `json:"principalSubject,omitempty"`
