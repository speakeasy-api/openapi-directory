If you set this field in AnalyzeContent or StreamingAnalyzeContent, Dialogflow will update Participant.obfuscated_external_user_id. Dialogflow uses this user id for following purposes: 1) Billing and measurement. If user with the same obfuscated_external_user_id is created in a later conversation, dialogflow will know it's the same user. 2) Agent assist suggestion personalization. For example, Dialogflow can use it to provide personalized smart reply suggestions for this user. Note: * Please never pass raw user ids to Dialogflow. Always obfuscate your user id first. * Dialogflow only accepts a UTF-8 encoded string, e.g., a hex digest of a hash function like SHA-512. * The length of the user id must be <= 256 characters.
