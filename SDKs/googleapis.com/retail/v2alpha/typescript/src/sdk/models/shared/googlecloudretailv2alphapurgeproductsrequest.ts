   * Required. The filter string to specify the products to be deleted with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Empty string filter is not allowed. "*" implies delete all items in a branch. The eligible fields for filtering are: * `availability`: Double quoted Product.availability string. * `create_time` : in ISO 8601 "zulu" format. Supported syntax: * Comparators (">", "<", ">=", "<=", "="). Examples: * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" * availability = "IN_STOCK" * Conjunctions ("AND") Examples: * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER" * Disjunctions ("OR") Examples: * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "IN_STOCK" * Can support nested queries. Examples: * (create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER") OR (create_time >= "2015-02-14T13:03:32Z" AND availability = "IN_STOCK") * Filter Limits: * Filter should not contain more than 6 conditions. * Max nesting depth should not exceed 2 levels. Examples queries: * Delete back order products created before a timestamp. create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "BACKORDER"
