/**
 * GoogleAppsDriveLabelsV2betaLifecycleInput - The lifecycle state of an object, such as label, field, or choice. The lifecycle enforces the following transitions: * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` (starting state) * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -&gt; `PUBLISHED` * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -&gt; (Deleted) * `PUBLISHED` -&gt; `DISABLED` * `DISABLED` -&gt; `PUBLISHED` * `DISABLED` -&gt; (Deleted) The published and disabled states have some distinct characteristics: * Published\u2014Some kinds of changes might be made to an object in this state, in which case `has_unpublished_changes` will be true. Also, some kinds of changes are not permitted. Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing metadata related to the label are rejected. * Disabled\u2014When disabled, the configured `DisabledPolicy` takes effect.
