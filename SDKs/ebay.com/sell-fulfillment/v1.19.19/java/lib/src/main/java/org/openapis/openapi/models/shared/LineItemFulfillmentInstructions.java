     * This field is returned as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the order line item is qualified for eBay Guaranteed Delivery, or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if it is not eligible. Only domestic shipments are available for eBay Guaranteed Delivery. At this time, eBay Guaranteed Delivery is only available to a select number of sellers on the US and Australia sites, but this feature will be enabled on more eBay sites in 2019.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  There are two different eBay Guaranteed Delivery options - 'Handling time' option and 'Door-to-Door' option. With both options, the seller is commiting to getting the order delivered to the buyer within three business days after purchase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With the 'Handling time' option, the seller's stated handling time for a listing must be 'same-day' or '1-day', and at least one of the available shipping service options should have a shipping time that guarantees that the buyer receives the order on time. With this option, eBay will set the 'ship-by date' and expected delivery window for the seller, and the seller should just make sure they physically ship the order by the &lt;strong&gt;shipToDate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With the 'Door-to-door' option, the seller must create regional shipping rate tables (with shipping costs and delivery times based on destination regions), and then apply these regional shipping rates/delivery times to the listing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If a 'Door-to-door' order does not arrive on time, the seller must refund the buyer the full shipping cost (if any), and the buyer also has the option of returning the item for a full refund, and the seller will also have to pay the return shipping cost. With 'Handling time' option, as long as the seller meets the stated handling time, and ships using the correct shipping service option, eBay will refund the buyer the shipping cost and pay for return shipping label (if buyer wants to return item) if the order arrives after the expected delivery time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more information on the details and requirements of eBay Guaranteed Delivery, see the &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/shipping-items/offering-ebay-guaranteed-delivery?id=4645 " target="_blank"&gt;Offering eBay Guaranteed Delivery&lt;/a&gt; help topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This field will always be returned regardless of whether the listing site offers eBay Guaranteed Delivery or if the seller is opted in to the feature.
