This field has the same type as the `attribute_scores` field in AnalyzeCommentResponse. To specify an overall attribute score for the entire comment as a whole, use the `summary_score` field of the mapped AttributeScores object. To specify scores on specific subparts of the comment, use the `span_scores` field. All SpanScore objects must have begin and end fields set. All Score objects must be explicitly set (for binary classification, use the score values 0 and 1). If Score objects don't include a ScoreType, `PROBABILITY` is assumed. `attribute_scores` must not be empty. The mapped AttributeScores objects also must not be empty. An `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned for all malformed requests.
