## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `GETAbortEnvironmentUpdate` - Cancels in-progress environment configuration update or application version deployment.
* `GETApplyEnvironmentManagedAction` - Applies a scheduled managed action immediately. A managed action can be applied only if its status is <code>Scheduled</code>. Get the status and action ID of a managed action with <a>DescribeEnvironmentManagedActions</a>.
* `GETAssociateEnvironmentOperationsRole` - Add or change the operations role used by an environment. After this call is made, Elastic Beanstalk uses the associated operations role for permissions to downstream services during subsequent calls acting on this environment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-operationsrole.html">Operations roles</a> in the <i>AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide</i>.
* `GETCheckDNSAvailability` - Checks if the specified CNAME is available.
* `GETComposeEnvironments` - Create or update a group of environments that each run a separate component of a single application. Takes a list of version labels that specify application source bundles for each of the environments to create or update. The name of each environment and other required information must be included in the source bundles in an environment manifest named <code>env.yaml</code>. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-mgmt-compose.html">Compose Environments</a> for details.
* `GETCreateStorageLocation` - Creates a bucket in Amazon S3 to store application versions, logs, and other files used by Elastic Beanstalk environments. The Elastic Beanstalk console and EB CLI call this API the first time you create an environment in a region. If the storage location already exists, <code>CreateStorageLocation</code> still returns the bucket name but does not create a new bucket.
* `GETDeleteApplication` - <p>Deletes the specified application along with all associated versions and configurations. The application versions will not be deleted from your Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <note> <p>You cannot delete an application that has a running environment.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteApplicationVersion` - <p>Deletes the specified version from the specified application.</p> <note> <p>You cannot delete an application version that is associated with a running environment.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteConfigurationTemplate` - <p>Deletes the specified configuration template.</p> <note> <p>When you launch an environment using a configuration template, the environment gets a copy of the template. You can delete or modify the environment's copy of the template without affecting the running environment.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteEnvironmentConfiguration` - <p>Deletes the draft configuration associated with the running environment.</p> <p>Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using <a>DescribeConfigurationSettings</a> while the update is in progress or if the update fails. The <code>DeploymentStatus</code> for the draft configuration indicates whether the deployment is in process or has failed. The draft configuration remains in existence until it is deleted with this action.</p>
* `GETDeletePlatformVersion` - Deletes the specified version of a custom platform.
* `GETDescribeAccountAttributes` - <p>Returns attributes related to AWS Elastic Beanstalk that are associated with the calling AWS account.</p> <p>The result currently has one set of attributes—resource quotas.</p>
* `GETDescribeApplicationVersions` - Retrieve a list of application versions.
* `GETDescribeApplications` - Returns the descriptions of existing applications.
* `GETDescribeConfigurationSettings` - <p>Returns a description of the settings for the specified configuration set, that is, either a configuration template or the configuration set associated with a running environment.</p> <p>When describing the settings for the configuration set associated with a running environment, it is possible to receive two sets of setting descriptions. One is the deployed configuration set, and the other is a draft configuration of an environment that is either in the process of deployment or that failed to deploy.</p> <p>Related Topics</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteEnvironmentConfiguration</a> </p> </li> </ul>

Compare to <a>ListPlatformVersions</a>, which provides summary information about a list of platform versions.</p> <p>For definitions of platform version and other platform-related terms, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-glossary.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms Glossary</a>.</p>
* `GETDisassociateEnvironmentOperationsRole` - Disassociate the operations role from an environment. After this call is made, Elastic Beanstalk uses the caller's permissions for permissions to downstream services during subsequent calls acting on this environment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-operationsrole.html">Operations roles</a> in the <i>AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide</i>.

* `GETRequestEnvironmentInfo` - <p>Initiates a request to compile the specified type of information of the deployed environment.</p> <p> Setting the <code>InfoType</code> to <code>tail</code> compiles the last lines from the application server log files of every Amazon EC2 instance in your environment. </p> <p> Setting the <code>InfoType</code> to <code>bundle</code> compresses the application server log files for every Amazon EC2 instance into a <code>.zip</code> file. Legacy and .NET containers do not support bundle logs. </p> <p> Use <a>RetrieveEnvironmentInfo</a> to obtain the set of logs. </p> <p>Related Topics</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>RetrieveEnvironmentInfo</a> </p> </li> </ul>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
