Upon insertion, it represents the *intended* status of the link. Re-uploading a link with status `active` when it's still pending or with status `pending` when it's already active will have no effect: the status will remain unchanged. Re-uploading a link with deprecated status `inactive` is equivalent to not submitting the link at all and will delete the link if it was active or cancel the link request if it was pending.
