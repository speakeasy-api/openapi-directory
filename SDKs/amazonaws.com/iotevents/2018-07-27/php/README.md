### SDK SDK

* `createAlarmModel` - Creates an alarm model to monitor an AWS IoT Events input attribute. You can use the alarm to get notified when the value is outside a specified range. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/create-alarms.html">Create an alarm model</a> in the <i>AWS IoT Events Developer Guide</i>.
* `createDetectorModel` - Creates a detector model.
* `createInput` - Creates an input.
* `deleteAlarmModel` - Deletes an alarm model. Any alarm instances that were created based on this alarm model are also deleted. This action can't be undone.
* `deleteDetectorModel` - Deletes a detector model. Any active instances of the detector model are also deleted.
* `deleteInput` - Deletes an input.
* `describeAlarmModel` - Retrieves information about an alarm model. If you don't specify a value for the <code>alarmModelVersion</code> parameter, the latest version is returned.
* `describeDetectorModel` - Describes a detector model. If the <code>version</code> parameter is not specified, information about the latest version is returned.
* `describeDetectorModelAnalysis` - <p>Retrieves runtime information about a detector model analysis.</p> <note> <p>After AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.</p> </note>
* `describeInput` - Describes an input.
* `describeLoggingOptions` - Retrieves the current settings of the AWS IoT Events logging options.
* `getDetectorModelAnalysisResults` - <p>Retrieves one or more analysis results of the detector model.</p> <note> <p>After AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.</p> </note>
* `listAlarmModelVersions` - Lists all the versions of an alarm model. The operation returns only the metadata associated with each alarm model version.
* `listAlarmModels` - Lists the alarm models that you created. The operation returns only the metadata associated with each alarm model.
* `listDetectorModelVersions` - Lists all the versions of a detector model. Only the metadata associated with each detector model version is returned.
* `listDetectorModels` - Lists the detector models you have created. Only the metadata associated with each detector model is returned.
* `listInputRoutings` -  Lists one or more input routings. 
* `listInputs` - Lists the inputs you have created.
* `listTagsForResource` - Lists the tags (metadata) you have assigned to the resource.
* `putLoggingOptions` - <p>Sets or updates the AWS IoT Events logging options.</p> <p>If you update the value of any <code>loggingOptions</code> field, it takes up to one minute for the change to take effect. If you change the policy attached to the role you specified in the <code>roleArn</code> field (for example, to correct an invalid policy), it takes up to five minutes for that change to take effect.</p>
* `startDetectorModelAnalysis` - Performs an analysis of your detector model. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/iotevents-analyze-api.html">Troubleshooting a detector model</a> in the <i>AWS IoT Events Developer Guide</i>.
* `tagResource` - Adds to or modifies the tags of the given resource. Tags are metadata that can be used to manage a resource.
* `untagResource` - Removes the given tags (metadata) from the resource.
* `updateAlarmModel` - Updates an alarm model. Any alarms that were created based on the previous version are deleted and then created again as new data arrives.
* `updateDetectorModel` - Updates a detector model. Detectors (instances) spawned by the previous version are deleted and then re-created as new inputs arrive.
* `updateInput` - Updates an input.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
