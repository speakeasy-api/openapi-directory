// GoogleCloudOrgpolicyV2PolicySpecPolicyRule - A rule used to express this policy.
type GoogleCloudOrgpolicyV2PolicySpecPolicyRule struct {
	// Setting this to true means that all values are allowed. This field can be set only in policies for list constraints.
	AllowAll *bool `json:"allowAll,omitempty"`
	// Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
	Condition *GoogleTypeExpr `json:"condition,omitempty"`
	// Setting this to true means that all values are denied. This field can be set only in policies for list constraints.
	DenyAll *bool `json:"denyAll,omitempty"`
	// If `true`, then the policy is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. This field can be set only in policies for boolean constraints.
	Enforce *bool `json:"enforce,omitempty"`
	// A message that holds specific allowed and denied values. This message can define specific values and subtrees of the Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - "projects/", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123" - "folders/", e.g. "folders/1234" - "organizations/", e.g. "organizations/1234" The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used.
