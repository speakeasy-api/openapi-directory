	// Optional. A JSON Web Token (JWT) issuer URI. `issuer` must start with `https://` and be a valid URL with length <2000 characters. If set, then Google will allow valid OIDC tokens from this issuer to authenticate within the workload_identity_pool. OIDC discovery will be performed on this URI to validate tokens from the issuer.
