// PersonResponse - The response for a single person
type PersonResponse struct {
	// **DEPRECATED** (Please use status instead) [HTTP 1.1 status code] (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
	HTTPStatusCode *int `json:"httpStatusCode,omitempty"`
	// Information about a person merged from various data sources such as the authenticated user's contacts and profile data. Most fields can have multiple items. The items in a field have no guaranteed order, but each non-empty field is guaranteed to have exactly one field with `metadata.primary` set to true.
	Person *Person `json:"person,omitempty"`
	// The original requested resource name. May be different than the resource name on the returned person. The resource name can change when adding or removing fields that link a contact and profile such as a verified email, verified phone number, or a profile URL.
	RequestedResourceName *string `json:"requestedResourceName,omitempty"`
	// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
	Status *Status `json:"status,omitempty"`
