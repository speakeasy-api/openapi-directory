/** <p>Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media. Specifying the <code>FRAGMENTED_MP4</code> container format packages the media into MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option is <code>MPEG_TS</code>. HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.</p> <p>The default is <code>FRAGMENTED_MP4</code>.</p> */
