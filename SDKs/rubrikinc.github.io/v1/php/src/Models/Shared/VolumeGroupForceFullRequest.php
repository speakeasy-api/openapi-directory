     * Configuration for forcing a full snapshot for the listed volumes in the request. The configuration specifies which volumes in a Volume Group should get forced full snapshots, and whether to perform deduplication. If the configuration is missing, no forced full snapshot is requested. If the configuration contains an empty array, a forced full snapshot is requested for all volumes in the Volume Group and deduplication is performed by default. If the configuration array contains specific volumes, a forced full snapshot is requested for these volumes only. The shouldDedupe flag determines whether deduplication is performed. If a forced full snapshot is requested, the next backup job checks the configuration and takes the full snapshot according to the specification. After the full snapshot is taken, the backup job clears the configuration to prevent additional full snapshots from being taken.
