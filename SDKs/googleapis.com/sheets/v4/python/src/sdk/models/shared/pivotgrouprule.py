    r"""Allows you to organize the date-time values in a source data column into buckets based on selected parts of their date or time values. For example, consider a pivot table showing sales transactions by date: +----------+--------------+ | Date | SUM of Sales | +----------+--------------+ | 1/1/2017 | $621.14 | | 2/3/2017 | $708.84 | | 5/8/2017 | $326.84 | ... +----------+--------------+ Applying a date-time group rule with a DateTimeRuleType of YEAR_MONTH results in the following pivot table. +--------------+--------------+ | Grouped Date | SUM of Sales | +--------------+--------------+ | 2017-Jan | $53,731.78 | | 2017-Feb | $83,475.32 | | 2017-Mar | $94,385.05 | ... +--------------+--------------+"""

    r"""Allows you to organize the numeric values in a source data column into buckets of a constant size. All values from HistogramRule.start to HistogramRule.end are placed into groups of size HistogramRule.interval. In addition, all values below HistogramRule.start are placed in one group, and all values above HistogramRule.end are placed in another. Only HistogramRule.interval is required, though if HistogramRule.start and HistogramRule.end are both provided, HistogramRule.start must be less than HistogramRule.end. For example, a pivot table showing average purchase amount by age that has 50+ rows: +-----+-------------------+ | Age | AVERAGE of Amount | +-----+-------------------+ | 16 | $27.13 | | 17 | $5.24 | | 18 | $20.15 | ... +-----+-------------------+ could be turned into a pivot table that looks like the one below by applying a histogram group rule with a HistogramRule.start of 25, an HistogramRule.interval of 20, and an HistogramRule.end of 65. +-------------+-------------------+ | Grouped Age | AVERAGE of Amount | +-------------+-------------------+ | < 25 | $19.34 | | 25-45 | $31.43 | | 45-65 | $35.87 | | > 65 | $27.55 | +-------------+-------------------+ | Grand Total | $29.12 | +-------------+-------------------+"""

    r"""Allows you to manually organize the values in a source data column into buckets with names of your choosing. For example, a pivot table that aggregates population by state: +-------+-------------------+ | State | SUM of Population | +-------+-------------------+ | AK | 0.7 | | AL | 4.8 | | AR | 2.9 | ... +-------+-------------------+ could be turned into a pivot table that aggregates population by time zone by providing a list of groups (for example, groupName = 'Central', items = ['AL', 'AR', 'IA', ...]) to a manual group rule. Note that a similar effect could be achieved by adding a time zone column to the source data and adjusting the pivot table. +-----------+-------------------+ | Time Zone | SUM of Population | +-----------+-------------------+ | Central | 106.3 | | Eastern | 151.9 | | Mountain | 17.4 | ... +-----------+-------------------+"""
