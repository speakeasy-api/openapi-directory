// GoogleCloudMlV1ExplanationConfig - Message holding configuration options for explaining model predictions. There are three feature attribution methods supported for TensorFlow models: integrated gradients, sampled Shapley, and XRAI. [Learn more about feature attributions.](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/ai-explanations/overview)
type GoogleCloudMlV1ExplanationConfig struct {
	// Attributes credit by computing the Aumann-Shapley value taking advantage of the model's fully differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for more details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365
	IntegratedGradientsAttribution *GoogleCloudMlV1IntegratedGradientsAttribution `json:"integratedGradientsAttribution,omitempty"`
	// An attribution method that approximates Shapley values for features that contribute to the label being predicted. A sampling strategy is used to approximate the value rather than considering all subsets of features.
	SampledShapleyAttribution *GoogleCloudMlV1SampledShapleyAttribution `json:"sampledShapleyAttribution,omitempty"`
	// Attributes credit by computing the XRAI taking advantage of the model's fully differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for more details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02825 Currently only implemented for models with natural image inputs.
