// Peer - This message defines attributes for a node that handles a network request. The node can be either a service or an application that sends, forwards, or receives the request. Service peers should fill in `principal` and `labels` as appropriate.
type Peer struct {
	// The IP address of the peer.
	IP *string `json:"ip,omitempty"`
	// The labels associated with the peer.
	Labels map[string]string `json:"labels,omitempty"`
	// The network port of the peer.
	Port *string `json:"port,omitempty"`
	// The identity of this peer. Similar to `Request.auth.principal`, but relative to the peer instead of the request. For example, the identity associated with a load balancer that forwarded the request.
	Principal *string `json:"principal,omitempty"`
	// The CLDR country/region code associated with the above IP address. If the IP address is private, the `region_code` should reflect the physical location where this peer is running.
