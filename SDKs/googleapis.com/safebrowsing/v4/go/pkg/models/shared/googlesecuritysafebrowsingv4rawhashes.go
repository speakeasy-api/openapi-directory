// GoogleSecuritySafebrowsingV4RawHashes - The uncompressed threat entries in hash format of a particular prefix length. Hashes can be anywhere from 4 to 32 bytes in size. A large majority are 4 bytes, but some hashes are lengthened if they collide with the hash of a popular URL. Used for sending ThreatEntrySet to clients that do not support compression, or when sending non-4-byte hashes to clients that do support compression.
type GoogleSecuritySafebrowsingV4RawHashes struct {
	// The number of bytes for each prefix encoded below. This field can be anywhere from 4 (shortest prefix) to 32 (full SHA256 hash).
	PrefixSize *int `json:"prefixSize,omitempty"`
	// The hashes, in binary format, concatenated into one long string. Hashes are sorted in lexicographic order. For JSON API users, hashes are base64-encoded.
	RawHashes *string `json:"rawHashes,omitempty"`
