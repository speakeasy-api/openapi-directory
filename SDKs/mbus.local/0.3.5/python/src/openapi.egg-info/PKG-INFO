## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `get` - Gets data from the slave identified by {address}
* `get_multi` - Gets data from the slave identified by {address}, and supports multiple responses from the slave
* `hat` - Gets Raspberry Pi Hat information

* `mbus_api` - Returns this API specification
* `scan` - Scan the specified device for slaves

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
