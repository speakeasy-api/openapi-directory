// GoogleAnalyticsAdminV1alphaEventCreateRule - An Event Create Rule defines conditions that will trigger the creation of an entirely new event based upon matched criteria of a source event. Additional mutations of the parameters from the source event can be defined. Unlike Event Edit rules, Event Creation Rules have no defined order. They will all be run independently. Event Edit and Event Create rules can't be used to modify an event created from an Event Create rule.
type GoogleAnalyticsAdminV1alphaEventCreateRule struct {
	// Required. The name of the new event to be created. This value must: * be less than 40 characters * consist only of letters, digits or _ (underscores) * start with a letter
	DestinationEvent *string `json:"destinationEvent,omitempty"`
