If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd".

Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard
