// GlueRecord - Defines a host on your domain that is a DNS name server for your domain and/or other domains. Glue records are a way of making the IP address of a name server known, even when it serves DNS queries for its parent domain. For example, when `ns.example.com` is a name server for `example.com`, the host `ns.example.com` must have a glue record to break the circular DNS reference.
type GlueRecord struct {
	// Required. Domain name of the host in Punycode format.
	HostName *string `json:"hostName,omitempty"`
	// List of IPv4 addresses corresponding to this host in the standard decimal format (e.g. `198.51.100.1`). At least one of `ipv4_address` and `ipv6_address` must be set.
	Ipv4Addresses []string `json:"ipv4Addresses,omitempty"`
	// List of IPv6 addresses corresponding to this host in the standard hexadecimal format (e.g. `2001:db8::`). At least one of `ipv4_address` and `ipv6_address` must be set.
	Ipv6Addresses []string `json:"ipv6Addresses,omitempty"`
