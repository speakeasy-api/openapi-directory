## Available Resources and Operations


### projects

* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_attach_trust` - Adds an AD trust to a domain.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_backups_create` - Creates a Backup for a domain.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_backups_list` - Lists Backup in a given project.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_check_migration_permission` - CheckMigrationPermission API gets the current state of DomainMigration
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_create` - Creates a Microsoft AD domain.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_detach_trust` - Removes an AD trust.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_disable_migration` - Disable Domain Migration
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_domain_join_machine` - DomainJoinMachine API joins a Compute Engine VM to the domain
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_enable_migration` - Enable Domain Migration
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_extend_schema` - Extend Schema for Domain
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_get_ldapssettings` - Gets the domain ldaps settings.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_list` - Lists domains in a project.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_reconfigure_trust` - Updates the DNS conditional forwarder.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_reset_admin_password` - Resets a domain's administrator password.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_restore` - RestoreBackup restores domain mentioned in the RestoreBackupRequest
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_sql_integrations_list` - Lists SqlIntegrations in a given domain.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_update_ldapssettings` - Patches a single ldaps settings.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_domains_validate_trust` - Validates a trust state, that the target domain is reachable, and that the target domain is able to accept incoming trust requests.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_operations_cancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_create` - Creates a Peering for Managed AD instance.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_delete` - Deletes identified Peering.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_get` - Gets details of a single Peering.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_get_iam_policy` - Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_list` - Lists Peerings in a given project.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_patch` - Updates the labels for specified Peering.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_set_iam_policy` - Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_global_peerings_test_iam_permissions` - Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.
* `managedidentities_projects_locations_list` - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
