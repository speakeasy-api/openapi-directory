// TrimWhitespaceRequest - Trims the whitespace (such as spaces, tabs, or new lines) in every cell in the specified range. This request removes all whitespace from the start and end of each cell's text, and reduces any subsequence of remaining whitespace characters to a single space. If the resulting trimmed text starts with a '+' or '=' character, the text remains as a string value and isn't interpreted as a formula.
type TrimWhitespaceRequest struct {
	// A range on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open, i.e. the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive -- [start_index, end_index). Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side. For example, if `"Sheet1"` is sheet ID 123456, then: `Sheet1!A1:A1 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 0, end_row_index: 1, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 1` `Sheet1!A3:B4 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 2, end_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A5:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1 == sheet_id: 123456` The start index must always be less than or equal to the end index. If the start index equals the end index, then the range is empty. Empty ranges are typically not meaningful and are usually rendered in the UI as `#REF!`.
