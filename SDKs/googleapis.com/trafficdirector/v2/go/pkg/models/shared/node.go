// Node - Identifies a specific Envoy instance. The node identifier is presented to the management server, which may use this identifier to distinguish per Envoy configuration for serving. [#next-free-field: 12]
type Node struct {
	// This is motivated by informing a management server during canary which version of Envoy is being tested in a heterogeneous fleet. This will be set by Envoy in management server RPCs. This field is deprecated in favor of the user_agent_name and user_agent_version values.
	BuildVersion *string `json:"buildVersion,omitempty"`
	// Client feature support list. These are well known features described in the Envoy API repository for a given major version of an API. Client features use reverse DNS naming scheme, for example `com.acme.feature`. See :ref:`the list of features ` that xDS client may support.
	ClientFeatures []string `json:"clientFeatures,omitempty"`
	// Defines the local service cluster name where Envoy is running. Though optional, it should be set if any of the following features are used: :ref:`statsd `, :ref:`health check cluster verification `, :ref:`runtime override directory `, :ref:`user agent addition `, :ref:`HTTP global rate limiting `, :ref:`CDS `, and :ref:`HTTP tracing `, either in this message or via :option:`--service-cluster`.
	Cluster *string `json:"cluster,omitempty"`
	// List of extensions and their versions supported by the node.
	Extensions []Extension `json:"extensions,omitempty"`
	// An opaque node identifier for the Envoy node. This also provides the local service node name. It should be set if any of the following features are used: :ref:`statsd `, :ref:`CDS `, and :ref:`HTTP tracing `, either in this message or via :option:`--service-node`.
	ID *string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Known listening ports on the node as a generic hint to the management server for filtering :ref:`listeners ` to be returned. For example, if there is a listener bound to port 80, the list can optionally contain the SocketAddress `(0.0.0.0,80)`. The field is optional and just a hint.
	ListeningAddresses []Address `json:"listeningAddresses,omitempty"`
	// Identifies location of where either Envoy runs or where upstream hosts run.
	Locality *Locality `json:"locality,omitempty"`
	// Opaque metadata extending the node identifier. Envoy will pass this directly to the management server.
	Metadata map[string]interface{} `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	// BuildVersion combines SemVer version of extension with free-form build information (i.e. 'alpha', 'private-build') as a set of strings.
	UserAgentBuildVersion *BuildVersion `json:"userAgentBuildVersion,omitempty"`
	// Free-form string that identifies the entity requesting config. E.g. "envoy" or "grpc"
	UserAgentName *string `json:"userAgentName,omitempty"`
	// Free-form string that identifies the version of the entity requesting config. E.g. "1.12.2" or "abcd1234", or "SpecialEnvoyBuild"
	UserAgentVersion *string `json:"userAgentVersion,omitempty"`
