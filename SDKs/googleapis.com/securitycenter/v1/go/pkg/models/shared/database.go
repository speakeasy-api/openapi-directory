// Database - Represents database access information, such as queries. A database may be a sub-resource of an instance (as in the case of Cloud SQL instances or Cloud Spanner instances), or the database instance itself. Some database resources might not have the [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) populated because these resource types, such as Cloud SQL databases, are not yet supported by Cloud Asset Inventory. In these cases only the display name is provided.
