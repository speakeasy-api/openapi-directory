 * Hub - A Network Connectivity Center hub is a global management resource to which you attach spokes. A single hub can contain spokes from multiple regions. However, if any of a hub's spokes use the site-to-site data transfer feature, the resources associated with those spokes must all be in the same VPC network. Spokes that do not use site-to-site data transfer can be associated with any VPC network in your project.
