### SDK SDK

* `AcceptEnvironmentAccountConnection` - <p>In a management account, an environment account connection request is accepted. When the environment account connection request is accepted, Proton can use the associated IAM role to provision environment infrastructure resources in the associated environment account.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-account-connections.html">Environment account connections</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p>
* `CancelComponentDeployment` - <p>Attempts to cancel a component deployment (for a component that is in the <code>IN_PROGRESS</code> deployment status).</p> <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* `CancelEnvironmentDeployment` - <p>Attempts to cancel an environment deployment on an <a>UpdateEnvironment</a> action, if the deployment is <code>IN_PROGRESS</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-update.html">Update an environment</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p> <p>The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state is <code>CANCELLED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is <code>FAILED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the current <a>UpdateEnvironment</a> action succeeds before the cancellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is <code>SUCCEEDED</code> and the cancellation attempt has no effect.</p> </li> </ul>
* `CancelServiceInstanceDeployment` - <p>Attempts to cancel a service instance deployment on an <a>UpdateServiceInstance</a> action, if the deployment is <code>IN_PROGRESS</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-svc-instance-update.html">Update a service instance</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p> <p>The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state is <code>CANCELLED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is <code>FAILED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the current <a>UpdateServiceInstance</a> action succeeds before the cancellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is <code>SUCCEEDED</code> and the cancellation attempt has no effect.</p> </li> </ul>

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-svc-pipeline-update.html">Update a service pipeline</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p> <p>The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state is <code>CANCELLED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is <code>FAILED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the current <a>UpdateServicePipeline</a> action succeeds before the cancellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is <code>SUCCEEDED</code> and the cancellation attempt has no effect.</p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateComponent` - <p>Create an Proton component. A component is an infrastructure extension for a service instance.</p> <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateEnvironment` - <p>Deploy a new environment. An Proton environment is created from an environment template that defines infrastructure and resources that can be shared across services.</p> <p class="title"> <b>You can provision environments using the following methods:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning: Proton makes direct calls to provision your resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-managed provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your repository to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your IaC engine uses to provision resources.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-environments.html">Environments</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html">Provisioning methods</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection` - <p>Create an environment account connection in an environment account so that environment infrastructure resources can be provisioned in the environment account from a management account.</p> <p>An environment account connection is a secure bi-directional connection between a <i>management account</i> and an <i>environment account</i> that maintains authorization and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-account-connections.html">Environment account connections</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateEnvironmentTemplate` - <p>Create an environment template for Proton. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-templates.html">Environment Templates</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can create an environment template in one of the two following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Register and publish a <i>standard</i> environment template that instructs Proton to deploy and manage environment infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Register and publish a <i>customer managed</i> environment template that connects Proton to your existing provisioned infrastructure that you manage. Proton <i>doesn't</i> manage your existing provisioned infrastructure. To create an environment template for customer provisioned and managed infrastructure, include the <code>provisioning</code> parameter and set the value to <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/template-create.html">Register and publish an environment template</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion` - Create a new major or minor version of an environment template. A major version of an environment template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backwards compatible. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backwards compatible within its major version.
* `CreateRepository` - <p>Create and register a link to a repository. Proton uses the link to repeatedly access the repository, to either push to it (self-managed provisioning) or pull from it (template sync). You can share a linked repository across multiple resources (like environments using self-managed provisioning, or synced templates). When you create a repository link, Proton creates a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked role</a> for you.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html#ag-works-prov-methods-self">Self-managed provisioning</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-authoring.html#ag-template-bundles">Template bundles</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-sync-configs.html">Template sync configurations</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateService` - Create an Proton service. An Proton service is an instantiation of a service template and often includes several service instances and pipeline. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-services.html">Services</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.
* `CreateServiceTemplate` - Create a service template. The administrator creates a service template to define standardized infrastructure and an optional CI/CD service pipeline. Developers, in turn, select the service template from Proton. If the selected service template includes a service pipeline definition, they provide a link to their source code repository. Proton then deploys and manages the infrastructure defined by the selected service template. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-templates.html">Proton templates</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.
* `CreateServiceTemplateVersion` - Create a new major or minor version of a service template. A major version of a service template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backward compatible. A minor version of a service template is a version that's backward compatible within its major version.
* `CreateTemplateSyncConfig` - <p>Set up a template to create new template versions automatically by tracking a linked repository. A linked repository is a repository that has been registered with Proton. For more information, see <a>CreateRepository</a>.</p> <p>When a commit is pushed to your linked repository, Proton checks for changes to your repository template bundles. If it detects a template bundle change, a new major or minor version of its template is created, if the version doesn’t already exist. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-sync-configs.html">Template sync configurations</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>

* `DeleteEnvironment` - Delete an environment.
* `DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection` - <p>In an environment account, delete an environment account connection.</p> <p>After you delete an environment account connection that’s in use by an Proton environment, Proton <i>can’t</i> manage the environment infrastructure resources until a new environment account connection is accepted for the environment account and associated environment. You're responsible for cleaning up provisioned resources that remain without an environment connection.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-account-connections.html">Environment account connections</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p>
* `DeleteEnvironmentTemplate` - If no other major or minor versions of an environment template exist, delete the environment template.
* `DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion` - <p>If no other minor versions of an environment template exist, delete a major version of the environment template if it's not the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete the <code>Recommended</code> version of the environment template if no other major versions or minor versions of the environment template exist. A major version of an environment template is a version that's not backward compatible.</p> <p>Delete a minor version of an environment template if it <i>isn't</i> the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete a <code>Recommended</code> minor version of the environment template if no other minor versions of the environment template exist. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backward compatible.</p>
* `DeleteRepository` - De-register and unlink your repository.
* `DeleteService` - <p>Delete a service, with its instances and pipeline.</p> <note> <p>You can't delete a service if it has any service instances that have components attached to them.</p> <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `DeleteServiceTemplate` - If no other major or minor versions of the service template exist, delete the service template.
* `DeleteServiceTemplateVersion` - <p>If no other minor versions of a service template exist, delete a major version of the service template if it's not the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete the <code>Recommended</code> version of the service template if no other major versions or minor versions of the service template exist. A major version of a service template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backwards compatible.</p> <p>Delete a minor version of a service template if it's not the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete a <code>Recommended</code> minor version of the service template if no other minor versions of the service template exist. A minor version of a service template is a version that's backwards compatible.</p>

* `GetRepositorySyncStatus` - <p>Get the sync status of a repository used for Proton template sync. For more information about template sync, see .</p> <note> <p>A repository sync status isn't tied to the Proton Repository resource (or any other Proton resource). Therefore, tags on an Proton Repository resource have no effect on this action. Specifically, you can't use these tags to control access to this action using Attribute-based access control (ABAC).</p> <p>For more information about ABAC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-tags">ABAC</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `GetResourcesSummary` - <p>Get counts of Proton resources.</p> <p>For infrastructure-provisioning resources (environments, services, service instances, pipelines), the action returns staleness counts. A resource is stale when it's behind the recommended version of the Proton template that it uses and it needs an update to become current.</p> <p>The action returns staleness counts (counts of resources that are up-to-date, behind a template major version, or behind a template minor version), the total number of resources, and the number of resources that are in a failed state, grouped by resource type. Components, environments, and service templates are exceptions—see the <code>components</code>, <code>environments</code>, and <code>serviceTemplates</code> field descriptions.</p> <p>For context, the action also returns the total number of each type of Proton template in the Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/monitoring-dashboard.html">Proton dashboard</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
