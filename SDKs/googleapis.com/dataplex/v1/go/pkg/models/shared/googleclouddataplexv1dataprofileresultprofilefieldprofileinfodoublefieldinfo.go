	// A quartile divides the number of data points into four parts, or quarters, of more-or-less equal size. Three main quartiles used are: The first quartile (Q1) splits off the lowest 25% of data from the highest 75%. It is also known as the lower or 25th empirical quartile, as 25% of the data is below this point. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of a data set. So, 50% of the data lies below this point. The third quartile (Q3) splits off the highest 25% of data from the lowest 75%. It is known as the upper or 75th empirical quartile, as 75% of the data lies below this point. Here, the quartiles is provided as an ordered list of quartile values for the scanned data, occurring in order Q1, median, Q3.

	// Standard deviation of non-null values in the scanned data. NaN, if the field has a NaN.
	StandardDeviation *float64 `json:"standardDeviation,omitempty"`
