## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `check_domain` - Check domain availability
* `create_batch` - Create batch. Batch is then being processed until all provided items have been completed. At any time it can be `get` to provide current status with results optionally.
* `delete_batch` - Delete batch
* `domain_rank` - Check domain rank (authority).
* `get_batch` - Get batch
* `get_batches` - Get your batches
* `query_db` - Query domain database
* `whois` - WHOIS query for a domain
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
