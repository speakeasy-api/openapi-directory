type GoogleCloudVisionV1p2beta1Product struct {
	// User-provided metadata to be stored with this product. Must be at most 4096 characters long.
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// The user-provided name for this Product. Must not be empty. Must be at most 4096 characters long.
	DisplayName *string `json:"displayName,omitempty"`
	// The resource name of the product. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/products/PRODUCT_ID`. This field is ignored when creating a product.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Immutable. The category for the product identified by the reference image. This should be one of "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", "toys-v2", "packagedgoods-v1" or "general-v1". The legacy categories "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still supported, but these should not be used for new products.
	ProductCategory *string `json:"productCategory,omitempty"`
	// Key-value pairs that can be attached to a product. At query time, constraints can be specified based on the product_labels. Note that integer values can be provided as strings, e.g. "1199". Only strings with integer values can match a range-based restriction which is to be supported soon. Multiple values can be assigned to the same key. One product may have up to 500 product_labels. Notice that the total number of distinct product_labels over all products in one ProductSet cannot exceed 1M, otherwise the product search pipeline will refuse to work for that ProductSet.
