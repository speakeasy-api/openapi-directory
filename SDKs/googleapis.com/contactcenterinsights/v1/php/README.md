### projects

* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsAnalysesCreate` - Creates an analysis. The long running operation is done when the analysis has completed.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsAnalysesList` - Lists analyses.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsBulkAnalyze` - Analyzes multiple conversations in a single request.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsCalculateStats` - Gets conversation statistics.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsCreate` - Creates a conversation.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsIngest` - Imports conversations and processes them according to the user's configuration.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsConversationsList` - Lists conversations.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsInsightsdataExport` - Export insights data to a destination defined in the request body.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsCalculateIssueModelStats` - Gets an issue model's statistics.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsCreate` - Creates an issue model.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsDeploy` - Deploys an issue model. Returns an error if a model is already deployed. An issue model can only be used in analysis after it has been deployed.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsIssuesList` - Lists issues.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsList` - Lists issue models.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsIssueModelsUndeploy` - Undeploys an issue model. An issue model can not be used in analysis after it has been undeployed.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsOperationsList` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsPhraseMatchersCreate` - Creates a phrase matcher.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsPhraseMatchersList` - Lists phrase matchers.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsViewsCreate` - Creates a view.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsViewsDelete` - Deletes a view.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsViewsGet` - Gets a view.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsViewsList` - Lists views.
* `contactcenterinsightsProjectsLocationsViewsPatch` - Updates a view.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
