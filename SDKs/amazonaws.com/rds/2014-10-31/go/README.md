### SDK SDK

* `GETAddRoleToDBCluster` - Associates an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a DB cluster.
* `GETAddRoleToDBInstance` - <p>Associates an Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a DB instance.</p> <note> <p>To add a role to a DB instance, the status of the DB instance must be <code>available</code>.</p> </note> <p>This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.</p>
* `GETAddSourceIdentifierToSubscription` - Adds a source identifier to an existing RDS event notification subscription.
* `GETApplyPendingMaintenanceAction` - Applies a pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a DB instance).
* `GETAuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress` - <p>Enables ingress to a DBSecurityGroup using one of two forms of authorization. First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecurityGroup if the application using the database is running on EC2 or VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the application accessing your database is running on the internet. Required parameters for this API are one of CIDR range, EC2SecurityGroupId for VPC, or (EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2SecurityGroupId for non-VPC).</p> <p>You can't authorize ingress from an EC2 security group in one Amazon Web Services Region to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. You can't authorize ingress from a VPC security group in one VPC to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another.</p> <p>For an overview of CIDR ranges, go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Wikipedia Tutorial</a>.</p> <note> <p>EC2-Classic was retired on August 15, 2022. If you haven't migrated from EC2-Classic to a VPC, we recommend that you migrate as soon as possible. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html">Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>, the blog <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/">EC2-Classic Networking is Retiring – Here’s How to Prepare</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC.html">Moving a DB instance not in a VPC into a VPC</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `GETBacktrackDBCluster` - <p>Backtracks a DB cluster to a specific time, without creating a new DB cluster.</p> <p>For more information on backtracking, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.html"> Backtracking an Aurora DB Cluster</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>This action applies only to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETCancelExportTask` - Cancels an export task in progress that is exporting a snapshot or cluster to Amazon S3. Any data that has already been written to the S3 bucket isn't removed.
* `GETCreateGlobalCluster` - <p>Creates an Aurora global database spread across multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.</p> <p>You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify an existing Aurora cluster during the create operation, and this cluster becomes the primary cluster of the global database.</p> <note> <p>This action applies only to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteBlueGreenDeployment` - <p>Deletes a blue/green deployment.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html">Using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for database updates</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html"> Using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for database updates</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETDeleteCustomDBEngineVersion` - <p>Deletes a custom engine version. To run this command, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The CEV must not be the default for RDS Custom. If it is, change the default before running this command.</p> </li> <li> <p>The CEV must not be associated with an RDS Custom DB instance, RDS Custom instance snapshot, or automated backup of your RDS Custom instance.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Typically, deletion takes a few minutes.</p> <note> <p>The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the <code>DeleteCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event aren't logged. However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls originate from the MediaImport service for the <code>DeleteCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event.</p> </note> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.delete">Deleting a CEV</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETDeleteDBCluster` - <p>The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the specified DB cluster are not deleted.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETDeleteDBClusterEndpoint` - <p>Deletes a custom endpoint and removes it from an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteDBClusterParameterGroup` - <p>Deletes a specified DB cluster parameter group. The DB cluster parameter group to be deleted can't be associated with any DB clusters.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETDeleteDBClusterSnapshot` - <p>Deletes a DB cluster snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the copy operation is terminated.</p> <note> <p>The DB cluster snapshot must be in the <code>available</code> state to be deleted.</p> </note> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETDeleteDBInstance` - <p>The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> are not deleted.</p> <p>If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is <code>deleting</code> until the DB snapshot is created. The API action <code>DescribeDBInstance</code> is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted.</p> <p>When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of <code>failed</code>, <code>incompatible-restore</code>, or <code>incompatible-network</code>, you can only delete it when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the <code>SkipFinalSnapshot</code> parameter.</p> <p>If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the <code>PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster</code> API action to promote the DB cluster so it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, then call the <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> API action to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.</p>
* `GETDeleteDBInstanceAutomatedBackup` - Deletes automated backups using the <code>DbiResourceId</code> value of the source DB instance or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the automated backups.
* `GETDeleteDBParameterGroup` - Deletes a specified DB parameter group. The DB parameter group to be deleted can't be associated with any DB instances.
* `GETDeleteDBProxy` - Deletes an existing DB proxy.
* `GETDeleteDBProxyEndpoint` - Deletes a <code>DBProxyEndpoint</code>. Doing so removes the ability to access the DB proxy using the endpoint that you defined. The endpoint that you delete might have provided capabilities such as read/write or read-only operations, or using a different VPC than the DB proxy's default VPC.
* `GETDeleteDBSecurityGroup` - <p>Deletes a DB security group.</p> <p>The specified DB security group must not be associated with any DB instances.</p> <note> <p>EC2-Classic was retired on August 15, 2022. If you haven't migrated from EC2-Classic to a VPC, we recommend that you migrate as soon as possible. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html">Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>, the blog <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/">EC2-Classic Networking is Retiring – Here’s How to Prepare</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC.html">Moving a DB instance not in a VPC into a VPC</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteDBSnapshot` - <p>Deletes a DB snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the copy operation is terminated.</p> <note> <p>The DB snapshot must be in the <code>available</code> state to be deleted.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteDBSubnetGroup` - <p>Deletes a DB subnet group.</p> <note> <p>The specified database subnet group must not be associated with any DB instances.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteEventSubscription` - Deletes an RDS event notification subscription.
* `GETDeleteGlobalCluster` - <p>Deletes a global database cluster. The primary and secondary clusters must already be detached or destroyed first.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETDeleteOptionGroup` - Deletes an existing option group.
* `GETDeregisterDBProxyTargets` - Remove the association between one or more <code>DBProxyTarget</code> data structures and a <code>DBProxyTargetGroup</code>.
* `GETDescribeAccountAttributes` - <p>Lists all of the attributes for a customer account. The attributes include Amazon RDS quotas for the account, such as the number of DB instances allowed. The description for a quota includes the quota name, current usage toward that quota, and the quota's maximum value.</p> <p>This command doesn't take any parameters.</p>
* `GETDescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes` - <p>Returns a list of DB cluster snapshot attribute names and values for a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>When sharing snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts, <code>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</code> returns the <code>restore</code> attribute and a list of IDs for the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to copy or restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. If <code>all</code> is included in the list of values for the <code>restore</code> attribute, then the manual DB cluster snapshot is public and can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p>To add or remove access for an Amazon Web Services account to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public or private, use the <code>ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute</code> API action.</p>
* `GETDescribeDBSnapshotAttributes` - <p>Returns a list of DB snapshot attribute names and values for a manual DB snapshot.</p> <p>When sharing snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts, <code>DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes</code> returns the <code>restore</code> attribute and a list of IDs for the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to copy or restore the manual DB snapshot. If <code>all</code> is included in the list of values for the <code>restore</code> attribute, then the manual DB snapshot is public and can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p>To add or remove access for an Amazon Web Services account to copy or restore a manual DB snapshot, or to make the manual DB snapshot public or private, use the <code>ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute</code> API action.</p>
* `GETDescribeValidDBInstanceModifications` - <p>You can call <code>DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications</code> to learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance. You can use this information when you call <code>ModifyDBInstance</code>.</p> <p>This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.</p>
* `GETDownloadDBLogFilePortion` - <p>Downloads all or a portion of the specified log file, up to 1 MB in size.</p> <p>This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.</p>
* `GETFailoverDBCluster` - <p>Forces a failover for a DB cluster.</p> <p>For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer).</p> <p>For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the readable standby DB instances (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer).</p> <p>An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary DB instance fails. A Multi-AZ DB cluster automatically fails over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB instance fails.</p> <p>To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETFailoverGlobalCluster` - <p>Initiates the failover process for an Aurora global database (<a>GlobalCluster</a>).</p> <p>A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.</p> <p>For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover">Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora global databases</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>This action applies to <a>GlobalCluster</a> (Aurora global databases) only. Use this action only on healthy Aurora global databases with running Aurora DB clusters and no Region-wide outages, to test disaster recovery scenarios or to reconfigure your Aurora global database topology.</p> </note>
* `GETModifyActivityStream` - <p>Changes the audit policy state of a database activity stream to either locked (default) or unlocked. A locked policy is read-only, whereas an unlocked policy is read/write. If your activity stream is started and locked, you can unlock it, customize your audit policy, and then lock your activity stream. Restarting the activity stream isn't required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Modifying.html"> Modifying a database activity stream</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>. </p> <p>This operation is supported for RDS for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
* `GETModifyCertificates` - <p>Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances, or remove the override.</p> <p>By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.</p> <p>You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity` - <p>Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to a specific value.</p> <p>Aurora Serverless v1 scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> to set the capacity explicitly.</p> <p>After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless v1 can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.</p> <p>For more information about Aurora Serverless v1, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html">Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>If you call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> with the default <code>TimeoutAction</code>, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from finding a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling"> Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETModifyCustomDBEngineVersion` - <p>Modifies the status of a custom engine version (CEV). You can find CEVs to modify by calling <code>DescribeDBEngineVersions</code>.</p> <note> <p>The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the <code>ModifyCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event aren't logged. However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls originate from the MediaImport service for the <code>ModifyCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event.</p> </note> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.modify">Modifying CEV status</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETModifyDBCluster` - <p>Modify the settings for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or a Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can change one or more settings by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GETModifyDBClusterEndpoint` - <p>Modifies the properties of an endpoint in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` - <p>Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify <code>restore</code> as the <code>AttributeName</code> and use the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value <code>all</code> to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <note> <p>Don't add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> </note> <p>If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.</p> <p>To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster snapshot is public or private, use the <a>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</a> API operation. The accounts are returned as values for the <code>restore</code> attribute.</p>
* `GETModifyDBProxyEndpoint` - Changes the settings for an existing DB proxy endpoint.
* `GETModifyDBProxyTargetGroup` - Modifies the properties of a <code>DBProxyTargetGroup</code>.
* `GETModifyDBSnapshot` - <p>Updates a manual DB snapshot with a new engine version. The snapshot can be encrypted or unencrypted, but not shared or public. </p> <p>Amazon RDS supports upgrading DB snapshots for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.</p>
* `GETModifyDBSnapshotAttribute` - <p>Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB snapshot.</p> <p>To share a manual DB snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify <code>restore</code> as the <code>AttributeName</code> and use the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB snapshot. Uses the value <code>all</code> to make the manual DB snapshot public, which means it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <note> <p>Don't add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> </note> <p>If the manual DB snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.</p> <p>To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB snapshot, or whether a manual DB snapshot public or private, use the <a>DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes</a> API operation. The accounts are returned as values for the <code>restore</code> attribute.</p>
* `GETModifyDBSubnetGroup` - Modifies an existing DB subnet group. DB subnet groups must contain at least one subnet in at least two AZs in the Amazon Web Services Region.
* `GETModifyEventSubscription` - <p>Modifies an existing RDS event notification subscription. You can't modify the source identifiers using this call. To change source identifiers for a subscription, use the <code>AddSourceIdentifierToSubscription</code> and <code>RemoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription</code> calls.</p> <p>You can see a list of the event categories for a given source type (<code>SourceType</code>) in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.html">Events</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i> or by using the <code>DescribeEventCategories</code> operation.</p>
* `GETModifyGlobalCluster` - <p>Modify a setting for an Amazon Aurora global cluster. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `GETPromoteReadReplica` - <p>Promotes a read replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a read replica to a standalone instance, we recommend that you enable backups and complete at least one backup prior to promotion. In addition, a read replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance when it is in the <code>backing-up</code> status. If you have enabled backups on your read replica, configure the automated backup window so that daily backups do not interfere with read replica promotion.</p> </li> <li> <p>This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, or RDS Custom.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `GETPromoteReadReplicaDBCluster` - Promotes a read replica DB cluster to a standalone DB cluster.
* `GETRebootDBCluster` - <p>You might need to reboot your DB cluster, usually for maintenance reasons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you change the DB cluster parameter group associated with the DB cluster, reboot the DB cluster for the changes to take effect.</p> <p>Rebooting a DB cluster restarts the database engine service. Rebooting a DB cluster results in a momentary outage, during which the DB cluster status is set to rebooting.</p> <p>Use this operation only for a non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB cluster.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide.</i> </p>

A Multi-AZ DB cluster automatically fails over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB instance fails.</p> <p>To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `POSTFailoverGlobalCluster` - <p>Initiates the failover process for an Aurora global database (<a>GlobalCluster</a>).</p> <p>A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.</p> <p>For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover">Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora global databases</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>This action applies to <a>GlobalCluster</a> (Aurora global databases) only.

* `POSTModifyActivityStream` - <p>Changes the audit policy state of a database activity stream to either locked (default) or unlocked. A locked policy is read-only, whereas an unlocked policy is read/write. If your activity stream is started and locked, you can unlock it, customize your audit policy, and then lock your activity stream. Restarting the activity stream isn't required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Modifying.html"> Modifying a database activity stream</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>. </p> <p>This operation is supported for RDS for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
* `POSTModifyCertificates` - <p>Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances, or remove the override.</p> <p>By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.</p> <p>You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p>
* `POSTModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity` - <p>Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to a specific value.</p> <p>Aurora Serverless v1 scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> to set the capacity explicitly.</p> <p>After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless v1 can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.</p> <p>For more information about Aurora Serverless v1, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html">Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>If you call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> with the default <code>TimeoutAction</code>, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from finding a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling"> Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `POSTModifyCustomDBEngineVersion` - <p>Modifies the status of a custom engine version (CEV). You can find CEVs to modify by calling <code>DescribeDBEngineVersions</code>.</p> <note> <p>The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the <code>ModifyCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event aren't logged. However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls originate from the MediaImport service for the <code>ModifyCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event.</p> </note> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.modify">Modifying CEV status</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `POSTModifyDBCluster` - <p>Modify the settings for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or a Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can change one or more settings by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p>
* `POSTModifyDBClusterEndpoint` - <p>Modifies the properties of an endpoint in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `POSTModifyDBClusterParameterGroup` - <p>Modifies the parameters of a DB cluster parameter group. To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: <code>ParameterName</code>, <code>ParameterValue</code>, and <code>ApplyMethod</code>. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request.</p> <important> <p>After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <code>DescribeDBClusterParameters</code> operation to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.</p> <p>If the modified DB cluster parameter group is used by an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster, Aurora applies the update immediately. The cluster restart might interrupt your workload. In that case, your application must reopen any connections and retry any transactions that were active when the parameter changes took effect.</p> </important> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide.</i> </p>
* `POSTModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` - <p>Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify <code>restore</code> as the <code>AttributeName</code> and use the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value <code>all</code> to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <note> <p>Don't add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> </note> <p>If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.</p> <p>To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster snapshot is public or private, use the <a>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</a> API operation. The accounts are returned as values for the <code>restore</code> attribute.</p>
* `POSTModifyDBInstance` - Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call <code>DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications</code> before you call <code>ModifyDBInstance</code>.
* `POSTModifyDBParameterGroup` - <p>Modifies the parameters of a DB parameter group. To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: <code>ParameterName</code>, <code>ParameterValue</code>, and <code>ApplyMethod</code>. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request.</p> <important> <p>After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.</p> </important>

* `POSTRestoreDBClusterToPointInTime` - <p>Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before <code>LatestRestorableTime</code> for up to <code>BackupRetentionPeriod</code> days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.</p> <note> <p>For Aurora, this action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the <code>CreateDBInstance</code> action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in <code>DBClusterIdentifier</code>. You can create DB instances only after the <code>RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime</code> action has completed and the DB cluster is available.</p> </note> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html"> Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide.</i> </p>
* `POSTRestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` - <p>Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.</p> <p>If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.</p> <p>If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the <code>DBSnapshotIdentifier</code> must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.</p> <note> <p>This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use <code>RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot</code>.</p> </note>
