// Exfiltration - Exfiltration represents a data exfiltration attempt from one or more sources to one or more targets. The `sources` attribute lists the sources of the exfiltrated data. The `targets` attribute lists the destinations the data was copied to.
type Exfiltration struct {
	// If there are multiple sources, then the data is considered "joined" between them. For instance, BigQuery can join multiple tables, and each table would be considered a source.
	Sources []ExfilResource `json:"sources,omitempty"`
	// If there are multiple targets, each target would get a complete copy of the "joined" source data.
	Targets []ExfilResource `json:"targets,omitempty"`
