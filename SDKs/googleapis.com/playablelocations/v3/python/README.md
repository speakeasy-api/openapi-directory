## SDK Available Operations

### v3

* `playablelocations_log_impressions` - Logs new events when playable locations are displayed, and when they are interacted with. Impressions are not partially saved; either all impressions are saved and this request succeeds, or no impressions are saved, and this request fails.
* `playablelocations_log_player_reports` - Logs bad playable location reports submitted by players. Reports are not partially saved; either all reports are saved and this request succeeds, or no reports are saved, and this request fails.
* `playablelocations_sample_playable_locations` - Returns a set of playable locations that lie within a specified area, that satisfy optional filter criteria. Note: Identical `SamplePlayableLocations` requests can return different results as the state of the world changes over time.
