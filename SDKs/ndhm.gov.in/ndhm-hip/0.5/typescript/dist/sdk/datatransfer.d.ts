     * postV05HealthInformationTransfer - health information transfer API
     *
     * **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway.
     *   1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU.
     *   2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred.
     *   3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request.
     *   4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is "application/fhir+json"
     *   5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption
     *   6. Please refer to the NDHM Sandbox Documentation for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content
