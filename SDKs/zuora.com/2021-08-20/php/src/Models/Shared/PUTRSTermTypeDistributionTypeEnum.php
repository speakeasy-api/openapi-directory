 * How you want to distribute the revenue. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * * Daily Distribution: Distributes revenue evenly across each day between the recognitionStart and recognitionEnd dates.
 * * Monthly Distribution (Back Load): Back loads the revenue so you distribute the monthly amount in the partial month in the end only.
 * * Monthly Distribution (Front Load): Front loads the revenue so you distribute the monthly amount in the partial month in the beginning only.
 * * Monthly Distribution (Proration by Days): Splits the revenue amount between the two partial months.
 * 
 * **Note:** To use any of the Monthly Distribution options, you must have the "Monthly recognition over time" model enabled in **Settings > Finance > Manage Revenue Recognition Models** in the Zuora UI.
