## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `batch_read_file` - Use this interface to get the result of a Read operation, employing the state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms optimized for text-heavy documents. When you use the Read File interface, the response contains a field called 'Operation-Location'. The 'Operation-Location' field contains the URL that you must use for your 'GetReadOperationResult' operation to access OCR results.â€‹
* `get_read_operation_result` - This interface is used for getting OCR results of Read operation. The URL to this interface should be retrieved from 'Operation-Location' field returned from Batch Read File interface.
* `get_text_operation_result` - This interface is used for getting text operation result. The URL to this interface should be retrieved from 'Operation-Location' field returned from Recognize Text interface.
* `recognize_text` - Recognize Text operation. When you use the Recognize Text interface, the response contains a field called 'Operation-Location'. The 'Operation-Location' field contains the URL that you must use for your Get Recognize Text Operation Result operation.
