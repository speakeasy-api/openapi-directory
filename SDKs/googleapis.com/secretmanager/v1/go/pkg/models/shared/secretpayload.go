// SecretPayload - A secret payload resource in the Secret Manager API. This contains the sensitive secret payload that is associated with a SecretVersion.
type SecretPayload struct {
	// The secret data. Must be no larger than 64KiB.
	Data *string `json:"data,omitempty"`
	// Optional. If specified, SecretManagerService will verify the integrity of the received data on SecretManagerService.AddSecretVersion calls using the crc32c checksum and store it to include in future SecretManagerService.AccessSecretVersion responses. If a checksum is not provided in the SecretManagerService.AddSecretVersion request, the SecretManagerService will generate and store one for you. The CRC32C value is encoded as a Int64 for compatibility, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type. https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#integer_types
