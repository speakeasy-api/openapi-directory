 * AccountBalance - The Banking Account Balances data type provides a list of balances for a bank account including end-of-day batch balance or running balances per transaction.

 * 
 * Responses are paged, so you should provide `page` and `pageSize` query parameters in your request.
 * 
 * > **How often should I pull Account Balances?**
 * >
 * > Because these balances are closing balances, we recommend you pull Account Balance no more frequently than daily. If you require a live intraday balance, this can be found for each account on the [Account](https://docs.codat.io/banking-api#/schemas/Account) data type.
 * > 
 * > Whilst you can choose to sync hourly, this may incur usage charges from Plaid or TrueLayer.
