/**
 * GooglePrivacyDlpV2FileSet - Set of files to scan.
 */
public class GooglePrivacyDlpV2FileSet {
    /**
     * Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in the bucket to include. Included files are those that match at least one item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`. Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For example, given the input `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}`: * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*` matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the full path doesn't match any items in `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [".*"]`). Some other common use cases: * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}` will include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}` will include all files directly under `gs://mybucket/directory/`, without matching across `/`
