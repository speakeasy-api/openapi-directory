 * Given a provided show id, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option
 * 
 * provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show given the show id.
 * 
 * The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
 * latest season along with `expand=all`. This would then return the detail of the latest season with
 * its list of child episode summaries, and also expand the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries.
 * 
 * Note the `id` parameter must be a show id for this parameter to work correctly.
