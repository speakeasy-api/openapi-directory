// GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3TransitionRoute - A transition route specifies a intent that can be matched and/or a data condition that can be evaluated during a session. When a specified transition is matched, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the transition, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified flow.
type GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3TransitionRoute struct {
	// The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters. See the [conditions reference](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition). At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
	Condition *string `json:"condition,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier of an Intent. Format: `projects//locations//agents//intents/`. Indicates that the transition can only happen when the given intent is matched. At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
	Intent *string `json:"intent,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The unique identifier of this transition route.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The target flow to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`.
	TargetFlow *string `json:"targetFlow,omitempty"`
	// The target page to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`.
	TargetPage *string `json:"targetPage,omitempty"`
	// A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page's entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both.
	TriggerFulfillment *GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3Fulfillment `json:"triggerFulfillment,omitempty"`
