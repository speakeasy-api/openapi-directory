	// A collection of stack frames, which can be truncated.

	// The hash ID is used to conserve network bandwidth for duplicate stack traces within a single trace. Often multiple spans will have identical stack traces. The first occurrence of a stack trace should contain both the `stackFrame` content and a value in `stackTraceHashId`. Subsequent spans within the same request can refer to that stack trace by only setting `stackTraceHashId`.
