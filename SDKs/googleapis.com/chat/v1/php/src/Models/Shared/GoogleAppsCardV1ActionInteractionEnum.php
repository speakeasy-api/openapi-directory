/** Optional. Required when opening a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). What to do in response to an interaction with a user, such as a user clicking button on a card message. If unspecified, the app responds by executing an `action` - like opening a link or running a function - as normal. By specifying an `interaction`, the app can respond in special interactive ways. For example, by setting `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`, the app can open a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). When specified, a loading indicator is not shown. Supported by Chat apps, but not Google Workspace Add-ons. If specified for an add-on, the entire card is stripped and nothing is shown in the client. */
