This should not include a script tag (e.g. use "cmn-cn" rather than "cmn-Hant-cn"), because the script will be inferred from the input provided in the SynthesisInput. The TTS service will use this parameter to help choose an appropriate voice. Note that the TTS service may choose a voice with a slightly different language code than the one selected; it may substitute a different region (e.g. using en-US rather than en-CA if there isn't a Canadian voice available), or even a different language, e.g. using "nb" (Norwegian Bokmal) instead of "no" (Norwegian)".
