These details will be used when calling the generateSshScript method (see https://cloud.google.com/database-migration/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.migrationJobs/generateSshScript) to produce the script that will help set up the reverse SSH tunnel, and to set up the VPC peering between the Cloud SQL private network and the VPC.
