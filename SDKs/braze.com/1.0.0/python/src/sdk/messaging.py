class Messaging:
    r"""The Braze messaging API provides you with two distinct options for sending messages to your users. You can provide the message contents and configuration in the API request with the /messages/send and /messages/schedule endpoints. Alternatively, you can manage the details of your message with an API-Triggered Delivery campaign in the dashboard and just control when and to whom it is sent with the campaigns/trigger/send and campaigns/trigger/schedule endpoints. The following sections will detail the request specification for both methods.
    
    The examples below contain the URL https://rest.iad-01.braze.com, but some customers will need to use a different endpoint URL, for example if you are hosted in Braze’s EU data center or have a dedicated Braze installation. Your Success Manager will inform you if you should use a different endpoint URL.
    
    Similarly to other campaigns, you can limit the number of times a particular user can receive a Messaging API campaign by configuring re-eligibility settings in the Braze Dashboard. Braze will not deliver API messages to users that haven’t become re-eligible for the campaign regardless of how many API requests are sent.

Please note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Canvas ID, created when you build a Canvas.
