    `members` can have the following values:
    
    * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is
       on the internet; with or without a Google account.
    
    * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone
       who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
    
    * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
       account. For example, `alice@example.com` .
    
    
    * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service
       account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
    
    * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group.
       For example, `admins@example.com`.
    
    * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
       identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For
       example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is
       recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user
       retains the role in the binding.
    
    * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus
       unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently
       deleted. For example,
       `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.
       If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
       `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the
       role in the binding.

       identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently
       deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If
       the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the
       recovered group retains the role in the binding.
