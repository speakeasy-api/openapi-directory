## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `create_project` -  Creates an AWS Mobile Hub project. 
* `delete_project` -  Delets a project in AWS Mobile Hub. 
* `describe_bundle` -  Get the bundle details for the requested bundle id. 
* `describe_project` -  Gets details about a project in AWS Mobile Hub. 
* `export_bundle` -  Generates customized software development kit (SDK) and or tool packages used to integrate mobile web or mobile app clients with backend AWS resources. 
* `export_project` -  Exports project configuration to a snapshot which can be downloaded and shared. Note that mobile app push credentials are encrypted in exported projects, so they can only be shared successfully within the same AWS account. 
* `list_bundles` -  List all available bundles. 
* `list_projects` -  Lists projects in AWS Mobile Hub. 
* `update_project` -  Update an existing project. 
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
