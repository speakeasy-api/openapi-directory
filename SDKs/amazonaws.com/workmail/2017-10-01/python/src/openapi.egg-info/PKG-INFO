## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `associate_delegate_to_resource` - Adds a member (user or group) to the resource's set of delegates.
* `associate_member_to_group` - Adds a member (user or group) to the group's set.
* `assume_impersonation_role` - Assumes an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization. This method returns an authentication token you can use to make impersonated calls.
* `cancel_mailbox_export_job` - <p>Cancels a mailbox export job.</p> <note> <p>If the mailbox export job is near completion, it might not be possible to cancel it.</p> </note>
* `create_alias` - Adds an alias to the set of a given member (user or group) of WorkMail.
* `create_availability_configuration` - Creates an <code>AvailabilityConfiguration</code> for the given WorkMail organization and domain.
* `create_group` - Creates a group that can be used in WorkMail by calling the <a>RegisterToWorkMail</a> operation.
* `create_impersonation_role` - <p>Creates an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization.</p> <p> <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, any subsequent retries also complete successfully without performing any further actions.</p>
* `create_mobile_device_access_rule` - Creates a new mobile device access rule for the specified WorkMail organization.
* `create_organization` - <p>Creates a new WorkMail organization. Optionally, you can choose to associate an existing AWS Directory Service directory with your organization. If an AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified, the organization alias must match the directory alias. If you choose not to associate an existing directory with your organization, then we create a new WorkMail directory for you. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_new_organization.html">Adding an organization</a> in the <i>WorkMail Administrator Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then choose your default email domain from the WorkMail console. You can also associate a domain that is managed in an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_domain.html">Adding a domain</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/default_domain.html">Choosing the default domain</a> in the <i>WorkMail Administrator Guide</i>.</p> <p>Optionally, you can use a customer managed key from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt email for your organization. If you don't associate an AWS KMS key, WorkMail creates a default, AWS managed key for you.</p>
* `create_resource` - Creates a new WorkMail resource.
* `create_user` - Creates a user who can be used in WorkMail by calling the <a>RegisterToWorkMail</a> operation.
* `delete_access_control_rule` - <p>Deletes an access control rule for the specified WorkMail organization.</p> <note> <p>Deleting already deleted and non-existing rules does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.</p> </note>
* `delete_alias` - Remove one or more specified aliases from a set of aliases for a given user.
* `delete_availability_configuration` - Deletes the <code>AvailabilityConfiguration</code> for the given WorkMail organization and domain.
* `delete_email_monitoring_configuration` - Deletes the email monitoring configuration for a specified organization.
* `delete_group` - Deletes a group from WorkMail.
* `delete_impersonation_role` - Deletes an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization.
* `delete_mailbox_permissions` - Deletes permissions granted to a member (user or group).
* `delete_mobile_device_access_override` - <p>Deletes the mobile device access override for the given WorkMail organization, user, and device.</p> <note> <p>Deleting already deleted and non-existing overrides does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.</p> </note>
* `delete_mobile_device_access_rule` - <p>Deletes a mobile device access rule for the specified WorkMail organization.</p> <note> <p>Deleting already deleted and non-existing rules does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.</p> </note>
* `delete_organization` - Deletes an WorkMail organization and all underlying AWS resources managed by WorkMail as part of the organization. You can choose whether to delete the associated directory. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/remove_organization.html">Removing an organization</a> in the <i>WorkMail Administrator Guide</i>.
* `delete_resource` - Deletes the specified resource.
* `delete_retention_policy` - Deletes the specified retention policy from the specified organization.
* `delete_user` - <p>Deletes a user from WorkMail and all subsequent systems. Before you can delete a user, the user state must be <code>DISABLED</code>. Use the <a>DescribeUser</a> action to confirm the user state.</p> <p>Deleting a user is permanent and cannot be undone. WorkMail archives user mailboxes for 30 days before they are permanently removed.</p>
* `deregister_from_work_mail` - Mark a user, group, or resource as no longer used in WorkMail. This action disassociates the mailbox and schedules it for clean-up. WorkMail keeps mailboxes for 30 days before they are permanently removed. The functionality in the console is <i>Disable</i>.

* `get_impersonation_role` - Gets the impersonation role details for the given WorkMail organization.
* `get_impersonation_role_effect` - Tests whether the given impersonation role can impersonate a target user.
* `get_mail_domain` - Gets details for a mail domain, including domain records required to configure your domain with recommended security.
* `get_mailbox_details` - Requests a user's mailbox details for a specified organization and user.

It performs no change if the user, group, or resource is enabled and fails if the user, group, or resource is deleted. This operation results in the accumulation of costs. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/pricing">Pricing</a>. The equivalent console functionality for this operation is <i>Enable</i>.</p> <p>Users can either be created by calling the <a>CreateUser</a> API operation or they can be synchronized from your directory.

An anonymous invocation is one done without providing either a <code>SourceArn</code> or <code>SourceAccount</code> header.</p> <note> <p>The request must contain either one provider definition (<code>EwsProvider</code> or <code>LambdaProvider</code>) or the <code>DomainName</code> parameter. If the <code>DomainName</code> parameter is provided, the configuration stored under the <code>DomainName</code> will be tested.</p> </note>

* `update_mailbox_quota` - Updates a user's current mailbox quota for a specified organization and user.
* `update_mobile_device_access_rule` - Updates a mobile device access rule for the specified WorkMail organization.
* `update_primary_email_address` - Updates the primary email for a user, group, or resource. The current email is moved into the list of aliases (or swapped between an existing alias and the current primary email), and the email provided in the input is promoted as the primary.
* `update_resource` - Updates data for the resource. To have the latest information, it must be preceded by a <a>DescribeResource</a> call. The dataset in the request should be the one expected when performing another <code>DescribeResource</code> call.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
