## SDK Available Operations


### iamPolicies

* `cloudassetIamPoliciesSearchAll` - Searches all the IAM policies within a given accessible Resource Manager scope (project/folder/organization). This RPC gives callers especially administrators the ability to search all the IAM policies within a scope, even if they don't have `.getIamPolicy` permission of all the IAM policies. Callers should have `cloud.assets.SearchAllIamPolicies` permission on the requested scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.

### resources

* `cloudassetResourcesSearchAll` - Searches all the resources within a given accessible Resource Manager scope (project/folder/organization). This RPC gives callers especially administrators the ability to search all the resources within a scope, even if they don't have `.get` permission of all the resources. Callers should have `cloud.assets.SearchAllResources` permission on the requested scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
