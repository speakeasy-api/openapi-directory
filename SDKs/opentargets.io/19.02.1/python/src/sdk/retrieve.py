        Once we integrate all evidence connecting a target to a specific disease, we
         compute an association score by the means of an harmonic sum. This *association score* provides
         an indication of how strong the evidence behind each connection is and can be
         used to rank genes in order of likelihood as drug targets.
         The association ID is constructed by using the Ensembl ID of the gene and the
         EFO ID for the disease (e.g. ENSG00000073756-EFO_0003767).
         The method returns an association object, which contains the data and summary
         on each evidence type included in the calculation of the score, as well as the score itself.

        We call **evidence** a unit of data that support a connection between a target and a disease.
        The Open Targets Platform integrates multiple types of evidence including genetic associations,
        somatic mutations, RNA expression and target-disease associations mined from the literature.
        This method allows you to retrieve a single evidence item or a list of pieces of evidence by using their
        targetvalidation.org ID.
        
        Evidence IDs are unique within each data release (e.g. `8ed3d7568a8c6cac9c95cfb869bac762` for release 1.2).
        You can obtain a list of evidence and their IDs from other API calls such as [/public/evidence/filter](#!/public/get_public_evidence_filter).
        
        **Please note** that a specific evidence ID may change between data releases. We can not guarantee that a specific evidence ID will refer to the same piece of evidence connecting a target and its diseases.
