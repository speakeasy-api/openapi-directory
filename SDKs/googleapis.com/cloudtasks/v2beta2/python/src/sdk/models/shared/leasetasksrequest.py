    r"""`filter` can be used to specify a subset of tasks to lease. When `filter` is set to `tag=` then the response will contain only tasks whose tag is equal to ``. `` must be less than 500 characters. When `filter` is set to `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only tasks which have the same tag as the task with the oldest schedule_time will be returned. Grammar Syntax: * `filter = \\"tag=\\" tag | \\"tag_function=\\" function` * `tag = string` * `function = \\"oldest_tag()\\"` The `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have the same tag as the oldest task (ordered by schedule time). SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either string or [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-), only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. Tag which aren't UTF-8 encoded can't be used in the filter and the task's tag will be displayed as empty in Cloud Tasks."""

The task is leased until its schedule_time; thus, the task will not be returned to another LeaseTasks call before its schedule_time. After the worker has successfully finished the work associated with the task, the worker must call via AcknowledgeTask before the schedule_time. Otherwise the task will be returned to a later LeaseTasks call so that another worker can retry it. The maximum lease duration is 1 week. `lease_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second."""
