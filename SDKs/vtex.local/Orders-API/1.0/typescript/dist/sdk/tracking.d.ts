     * Update order tracking status
     *
     * @remarks
     * This endpoint sends a tracking event to an order that already has a tracking number registered to its invoice.
     *
     *
  This request is not meant to send tracking number and URL to the invoice. If you wish to send tracking number and URL to an order, use the [Update order's partial invoice API request](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#patch-/api/oms/pvt/orders/-orderId-/invoice/-invoiceNumber-). You can also learn more about [Partial invoice](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/partial-invoices--2xkTisx4SXOWXQel8Jg8sa/q9GPspTb9cHlMeAZfdEUe) scenarios.

  > The `Notify invoice` resource is needed to use this API request. This is included in `OMS - Full access` and `IntegrationProfile - Fulfillment Oms`, among other default roles available in the Admin. Learn more about the [License manager roles and resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc).
