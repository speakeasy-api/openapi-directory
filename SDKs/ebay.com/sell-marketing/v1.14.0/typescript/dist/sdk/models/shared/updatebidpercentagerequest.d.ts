     * The user-defined <b>bid percentage</b> (also known as the <i>ad rate</i>) sets the level that eBay increases the visibility in search results for the associated listing.

This percentage value is multiplied by the final sales price to determine the fee. <br><br>The Promoted Listings fee is determined at the time the transaction completes and the seller is assessed the fee only when an item sells through a Promoted Listings ad campaign. <br><br>The <b>bidPercentage</b> is a single precision value that is guided by the following rules: <ul><li>These values are <b>valid</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>4.1</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>5.0</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>5.5</code>, ...</li>  <li>These values are <b>not valid</b>:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>0.01</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>10.75</code>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>99.99</code>,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so on.</li></ul>This is default bid percentage for the campaigns using the Cost Per Sale (CPS) funding model, and this value will be overridden by any ads in the campaign that have their own set bid percentages.<br /><br />If a bid percentage is not provided for an ad, eBay uses the default bid percentage of the associated campaign.<br /><br /><b>Minimum value:</b> 2.0 <br><b>Maximum value:</b> 100.0
