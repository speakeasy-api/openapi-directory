"""Contains the list of servers available to the SDK"""

class SDK:
    r"""The Recurring APIs allow you to manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created with validation during a payment request.
    
    For more information, refer to our [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/tokenization).
    ## Authentication
    You need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) to authenticate to the API.
    
    If using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:
    
     ```
    curl
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \
    ...
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:
    
    ```
    curl
    -U \"ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    ...
    ```
    
    ## Versioning
    Recurring API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.
    
    For example:
    ```
    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v30/disable
    ```
    
    ## Going live
    
    To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.
    
    The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:
    ```
    
    https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v30/disable
    ```
    
    Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.
