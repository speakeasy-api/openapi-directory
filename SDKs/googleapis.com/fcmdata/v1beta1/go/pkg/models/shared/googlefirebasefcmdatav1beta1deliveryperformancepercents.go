// GoogleFirebaseFcmDataV1beta1DeliveryPerformancePercents - Overview of delivery performance for messages that were successfully delivered. All percentages are calculated with countMessagesAccepted as the denominator. These categories are not mutually exclusive; a message can be delayed for multiple reasons.
type GoogleFirebaseFcmDataV1beta1DeliveryPerformancePercents struct {
	// The percentage of accepted messages that were delayed because the device was in doze mode. Only [normal priority messages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#setting-the-priority-of-a-message) should be delayed due to doze mode.
	DelayedDeviceDoze *float32 `json:"delayedDeviceDoze,omitempty"`
	// The percentage of accepted messages that were delayed because the target device was not connected at the time of sending. These messages were eventually delivered when the device reconnected.
	DelayedDeviceOffline *float32 `json:"delayedDeviceOffline,omitempty"`
	// The percentage of accepted messages that were delayed due to message throttling, such as [collapsible message throttling](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#collapsible_throttling) or [maximum message rate throttling](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#device_throttling).
	DelayedMessageThrottled *float32 `json:"delayedMessageThrottled,omitempty"`
	// The percentage of accepted messages that were delayed because the intended device user-profile was [stopped](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#handling_messages) on the target device at the time of the send. The messages were eventually delivered when the user-profile was started again.
	DelayedUserStopped *float32 `json:"delayedUserStopped,omitempty"`
	// The percentage of accepted messages that were delivered to the device without delay from the FCM system.
	DeliveredNoDelay *float32 `json:"deliveredNoDelay,omitempty"`
