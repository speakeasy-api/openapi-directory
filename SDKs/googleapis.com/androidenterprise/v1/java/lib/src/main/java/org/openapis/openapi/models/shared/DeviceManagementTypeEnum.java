 * DeviceManagementTypeEnum - Identifies the extent to which the device is controlled by a managed Google Play EMM in various deployment configurations. Possible values include: - "managedDevice", a device that has the EMM's device policy controller (DPC) as the device owner. - "managedProfile", a device that has a profile managed by the DPC (DPC is profile owner) in addition to a separate, personal profile that is unavailable to the DPC. - "containerApp", no longer used (deprecated). - "unmanagedProfile", a device that has been allowed (by the domain's admin, using the Admin Console to enable the privilege) to use managed Google Play, but the profile is itself not owned by a DPC.
