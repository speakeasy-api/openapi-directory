// WalletTransactionExecuteRequest - WalletTransactionExecuteRequest defines the request schema for `/wallet/transaction/execute`
type WalletTransactionExecuteRequest struct {
	// The amount and currency of a transaction
	Amount map[string]interface{} `json:"amount"`
	// Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.
	ClientID *string `json:"client_id,omitempty"`

	// The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. If a request to execute a wallet transaction fails due to a network connection error, then after a minimum delay of one minute, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single wallet transaction is created. If the request was successfully processed, it will prevent any transaction that uses the same idempotency key, and was received within 24 hours of the first request, from being processed.
	IdempotencyKey string `json:"idempotency_key"`
	// A reference for the transaction. This must be an alphanumeric string with 6 to 18 characters and must not contain any special characters or spaces.
	// Ensure that the `reference` field is unique for each transaction.
	Reference string `json:"reference"`
	// Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.
	Secret *string `json:"secret,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the e-wallet to debit from
	WalletID string `json:"wallet_id"`
