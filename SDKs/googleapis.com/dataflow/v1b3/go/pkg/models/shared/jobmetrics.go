// JobMetrics - JobMetrics contains a collection of metrics describing the detailed progress of a Dataflow job. Metrics correspond to user-defined and system-defined metrics in the job. For more information, see [Dataflow job metrics] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf). This resource captures only the most recent values of each metric; time-series data can be queried for them (under the same metric names) from Cloud Monitoring.
type JobMetrics struct {
	// Timestamp as of which metric values are current.
	MetricTime *string `json:"metricTime,omitempty"`
	// All metrics for this job.
	Metrics []MetricUpdate `json:"metrics,omitempty"`
}
