## Available Resources and Operations

### [SDK](docs/sdk/README.md)

* [GETAbortEnvironmentUpdate](docs/sdk/README.md#getabortenvironmentupdate) - Cancels in-progress environment configuration update or application version deployment.
* [GETApplyEnvironmentManagedAction](docs/sdk/README.md#getapplyenvironmentmanagedaction) - Applies a scheduled managed action immediately. A managed action can be applied only if its status is <code>Scheduled</code>. Get the status and action ID of a managed action with <a>DescribeEnvironmentManagedActions</a>.
* [GETAssociateEnvironmentOperationsRole](docs/sdk/README.md#getassociateenvironmentoperationsrole) - Add or change the operations role used by an environment. After this call is made, Elastic Beanstalk uses the associated operations role for permissions to downstream services during subsequent calls acting on this environment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-operationsrole.html">Operations roles</a> in the <i>AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide</i>.
* [GETCheckDNSAvailability](docs/sdk/README.md#getcheckdnsavailability) - Checks if the specified CNAME is available.
* [GETComposeEnvironments](docs/sdk/README.md#getcomposeenvironments) - Create or update a group of environments that each run a separate component of a single application. Takes a list of version labels that specify application source bundles for each of the environments to create or update. The name of each environment and other required information must be included in the source bundles in an environment manifest named <code>env.yaml</code>. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-mgmt-compose.html">Compose Environments</a> for details.
* [GETCreateStorageLocation](docs/sdk/README.md#getcreatestoragelocation) - Creates a bucket in Amazon S3 to store application versions, logs, and other files used by Elastic Beanstalk environments. The Elastic Beanstalk console and EB CLI call this API the first time you create an environment in a region. If the storage location already exists, <code>CreateStorageLocation</code> still returns the bucket name but does not create a new bucket.
* [GETDeleteApplication](docs/sdk/README.md#getdeleteapplication) - <p>Deletes the specified application along with all associated versions and configurations. The application versions will not be deleted from your Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <note> <p>You cannot delete an application that has a running environment.</p> </note>

* [GETDeleteEnvironmentConfiguration](docs/sdk/README.md#getdeleteenvironmentconfiguration) - <p>Deletes the draft configuration associated with the running environment.</p> <p>Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using <a>DescribeConfigurationSettings</a> while the update is in progress or if the update fails. The <code>DeploymentStatus</code> for the draft configuration indicates whether the deployment is in process or has failed. The draft configuration remains in existence until it is deleted with this action.</p>
* [GETDeletePlatformVersion](docs/sdk/README.md#getdeleteplatformversion) - Deletes the specified version of a custom platform.
* [GETDescribeAccountAttributes](docs/sdk/README.md#getdescribeaccountattributes) - <p>Returns attributes related to AWS Elastic Beanstalk that are associated with the calling AWS account.</p> <p>The result currently has one set of attributesâ€”resource quotas.</p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
