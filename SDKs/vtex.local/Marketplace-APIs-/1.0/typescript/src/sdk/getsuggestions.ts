  /**
   * Get SKU Suggestion by ID
   *
   * @remarks
   * This endpoint retrieves the data of a specific SKU sent by the seller, to the marketplace. Marketplaces or external matchers can call this endpoint when they want to check the information about a single SKU.
   *
   * Note that all the information sent by the seller will be in the [content] object. All remaining information in this endpoint's response is given by the Matcher.
   *
   * Matcher rates received SKUs by correlating the data sent by sellers, to existing fields in the marketplace. The calculation of these scores determines whether the product has been:
   *
   * `Approved`: score equal to or greater than 80 points.
   *
   * `Pending`: from 31 to 79 points.
   *
   * `Denied`: from 0 to 30 points.
   *
   * Note that  if the autoApprove setting is enabled, the SKUs will be approved, regardless of the Score.
