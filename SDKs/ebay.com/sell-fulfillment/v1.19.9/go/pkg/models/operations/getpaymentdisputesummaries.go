type GetPaymentDisputeSummariesQueryParams struct {
	// This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes opened by a specific seller. The string that is passed in to this query parameter is the eBay user ID of the buyer.
	BuyerUsername *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=buyer_username"`
	// The value passed in this query parameter sets the maximum number of payment disputes to return per page of data. The value passed in this field should be an integer from 1 to 200. If this query parameter is not set, up to 200 records will be returned on each page of results. Min: 1; Max: 200; Default: 200
	Limit *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=limit"`
	// This field is used to specify the number of records to skip in the result set before returning the first payment dispute in the paginated response. A zero-based index is used, so if you set the offset value to 0 (default value), the first payment dispute in the result set appears at the top of the response. Combine offset with the limit parameter to control the payment disputes returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset value of 0 and a limit value of 10, the response will contain the first 10 payment disputes from the result set that matches the input criteria. If you supply an offset value of 10 and a limit value of 20, the response will contain payment disputes 11-30 from the result set that matches the input criteria. Min: 0; Max: total number of payment disputes - 1; Default: 0
	Offset *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=offset"`
	// The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_from field sets the beginning date of the date range, and can be set as far back as 18 months from the present time. If a open_date_from field is used, but a open_date_to field is not used, the open_date_to value will default to 90 days after the date specified in the open_date_from field, or to the present time if less than 90 days in the past. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z.
	OpenDateFrom *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=open_date_from"`
	// The open_date_from and/or open_date_to date filters are used if the seller wishes to retrieve payment disputes opened within a specific date range. A maximum date range that may be set with the open_date_from and/or open_date_to filters is 90 days. These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and the time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_to field sets the ending date of the date range, and can be set up to 90 days from the date set in the open_date_from field. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z.
	OpenDateTo *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=open_date_to"`
	// This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes filed against a specific order. It is possible that there can be more than one dispute filed against an order if the order has multiple line items. If this filter is used, any other filters are ignored. Note: The order identifier passed into this field must be an Order ID in the new format. The legacy APIs still support the old and new order ID format to identify orders, but only the new order ID format is supported in REST-based APIs. eBay rolled out a new Order ID format in June 2019.
	OrderID *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=order_id"`
	// This filter is used if the seller wishes to only retrieve payment disputes in a specific state. More than one value can be specified. If no payment_dispute_status filter is used, payment disputes in all states are returned in the response. See DisputeStateEnum type for supported values.
	PaymentDisputeStatus *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=payment_dispute_status"`
