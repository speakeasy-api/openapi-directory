Please call TrainAgent and wait for the operation it returns in order to train explicitly.

* [dialogflowProjectsLocationsAgentRestore](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsagentrestore) - Restores the specified agent from a ZIP file. Replaces the current agent version with a new one. All the intents and entity types in the older version are deleted. After the restore, the restored draft agent will be trained automatically (unless disabled in agent settings). However, once the restore is done, training may not be completed yet. Please call TrainAgent and wait for the operation it returns in order to train explicitly. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/long-running-operations).

* [dialogflowProjectsLocationsAgentSearch](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsagentsearch) - Returns the list of agents. Since there is at most one conversational agent per project, this method is useful primarily for listing all agents across projects the caller has access to. One can achieve that with a wildcard project collection id "-". Refer to [List Sub-Collections](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#list_sub-collections).

This method is not idempotent, because it may cause contexts and session entity types to be updated, which in turn might affect results of future queries. If you might use [Agent Assist](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/#aa) or other CCAI products now or in the future, consider using AnalyzeContent instead of `DetectIntent`. `AnalyzeContent` has additional functionality for Agent Assist and other CCAI products. Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions).
* [dialogflowProjectsLocationsAgentSessionsEntityTypesCreate](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsagentsessionsentitytypescreate) - Creates a session entity type.

* [dialogflowProjectsLocationsConversationsCreate](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsconversationscreate) - Creates a new conversation. Conversations are auto-completed after 24 hours. Conversation Lifecycle: There are two stages during a conversation: Automated Agent Stage and Assist Stage. For Automated Agent Stage, there will be a dialogflow agent responding to user queries. For Assist Stage, there's no dialogflow agent responding to user queries. But we will provide suggestions which are generated from conversation. If Conversation.conversation_profile is configured for a dialogflow agent, conversation will start from `Automated Agent Stage`, otherwise, it will start from `Assist Stage`. And during `Automated Agent Stage`, once an Intent with Intent.live_agent_handoff is triggered, conversation will transfer to Assist Stage.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage 
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally 
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !

### SDK Created by [Speakeasy](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/using-speakeasy/client-sdks)
