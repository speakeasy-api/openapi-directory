A component is an infrastructure extension for a service instance.</p> <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* [CreateEnvironment](docs/sdk/README.md#createenvironment) - <p>Deploy a new environment. An Proton environment is created from an environment template that defines infrastructure and resources that can be shared across services.</p> <p class="title"> <b>You can provision environments using the following methods:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning: Proton makes direct calls to provision your resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-managed provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your repository to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your IaC engine uses to provision resources.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-environments.html">Environments</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html">Provisioning methods</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* [CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection](docs/sdk/README.md#createenvironmentaccountconnection) - <p>Create an environment account connection in an environment account so that environment infrastructure resources can be provisioned in the environment account from a management account.</p> <p>An environment account connection is a secure bi-directional connection between a <i>management account</i> and an <i>environment account</i> that maintains authorization and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-account-connections.html">Environment account connections</a> in the <i>Proton User guide</i>.</p>
* [CreateEnvironmentTemplate](docs/sdk/README.md#createenvironmenttemplate) - <p>Create an environment template for Proton. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-templates.html">Environment Templates</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can create an environment template in one of the two following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Register and publish a <i>standard</i> environment template that instructs Proton to deploy and manage environment infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Register and publish a <i>customer managed</i> environment template that connects Proton to your existing provisioned infrastructure that you manage. Proton <i>doesn't</i> manage your existing provisioned infrastructure. To create an environment template for customer provisioned and managed infrastructure, include the <code>provisioning</code> parameter and set the value to <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/template-create.html">Register and publish an environment template</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul>
* [CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion](docs/sdk/README.md#createenvironmenttemplateversion) - Create a new major or minor version of an environment template. A major version of an environment template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backwards compatible. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backwards compatible within its major version.
* [CreateRepository](docs/sdk/README.md#createrepository) - <p>Create and register a link to a repository. Proton uses the link to repeatedly access the repository, to either push to it (self-managed provisioning) or pull from it (template sync). You can share a linked repository across multiple resources (like environments using self-managed provisioning, or synced templates). When you create a repository link, Proton creates a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked role</a> for you.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html#ag-works-prov-methods-self">Self-managed provisioning</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-authoring.html#ag-template-bundles">Template bundles</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-sync-configs.html">Template sync configurations</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
* [CreateService](docs/sdk/README.md#createservice) - Create an Proton service. An Proton service is an instantiation of a service template and often includes several service instances and pipeline. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-services.html">Services</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.
* [CreateServiceInstance](docs/sdk/README.md#createserviceinstance) - Create a service instance.
* [CreateServiceSyncConfig](docs/sdk/README.md#createservicesyncconfig) - Create the Proton Ops configuration file.
* [CreateServiceTemplate](docs/sdk/README.md#createservicetemplate) - Create a service template. The administrator creates a service template to define standardized infrastructure and an optional CI/CD service pipeline. Developers, in turn, select the service template from Proton. If the selected service template includes a service pipeline definition, they provide a link to their source code repository. Proton then deploys and manages the infrastructure defined by the selected service template. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-templates.html">Proton templates</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.
* [CreateServiceTemplateVersion](docs/sdk/README.md#createservicetemplateversion) - Create a new major or minor version of a service template. A major version of a service template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backward compatible. A minor version of a service template is a version that's backward compatible within its major version.
* [CreateTemplateSyncConfig](docs/sdk/README.md#createtemplatesyncconfig) - <p>Set up a template to create new template versions automatically by tracking a linked repository. A linked repository is a repository that has been registered with Proton. For more information, see <a>CreateRepository</a>.</p> <p>When a commit is pushed to your linked repository, Proton checks for changes to your repository template bundles. If it detects a template bundle change, a new major or minor version of its template is created, if the version doesn’t already exist. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-template-sync-configs.html">Template sync configurations</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>

Delete the <code>Recommended</code> version of the environment template if no other major versions or minor versions of the environment template exist. A major version of an environment template is a version that's not backward compatible.</p> <p>Delete a minor version of an environment template if it <i>isn't</i> the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete a <code>Recommended</code> minor version of the environment template if no other minor versions of the environment template exist. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backward compatible.</p>
* [DeleteRepository](docs/sdk/README.md#deleterepository) - De-register and unlink your repository.
* [DeleteService](docs/sdk/README.md#deleteservice) - <p>Delete a service, with its instances and pipeline.</p> <note> <p>You can't delete a service if it has any service instances that have components attached to them.</p> <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p> </note>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
