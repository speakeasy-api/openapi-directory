// Count - Count of documents that match the query. The `COUNT(*)` aggregation function operates on the entire document so it does not require a field reference.
type Count struct {
	// Optional. Optional constraint on the maximum number of documents to count. This provides a way to set an upper bound on the number of documents to scan, limiting latency and cost. Unspecified is interpreted as no bound. High-Level Example: ``` AGGREGATE COUNT_UP_TO(1000) OVER ( SELECT * FROM k ); ``` Requires: * Must be greater than zero when present.
	UpTo *string `json:"upTo,omitempty"`
