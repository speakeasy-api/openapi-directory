/**
 * ServiceConnectClientAlias - &lt;p&gt;Each alias ("endpoint") is a fully-qualified name and port number that other tasks ("clients") can use to connect to this service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each name and port mapping must be unique within the namespace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html"&gt;Service Connect&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
