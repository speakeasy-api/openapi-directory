   * Optional. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of an alert metadata from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform metadata updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response which contains alert metadata, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to update alert metadata to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the alert metadata. If no `etag` is provided in the call to update alert metadata, then the existing alert metadata is overwritten blindly.
