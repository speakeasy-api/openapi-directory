## SDK Available Operations


### projects

* `firebasemlProjectsModelsCreate` - Creates a model in Firebase ML. The longrunning operation will eventually return a Model
* `firebasemlProjectsModelsDelete` - Deletes a model
* `firebasemlProjectsModelsDownload` - Gets Download information for a model. This is meant for downloading model resources onto devices. It gives very limited information about the model.
* `firebasemlProjectsModelsList` - Lists the models
* `firebasemlProjectsModelsPatch` - Updates a model. The longrunning operation will eventually return a Model.
* `firebasemlProjectsOperationsGet` - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
