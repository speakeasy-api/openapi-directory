	// If set to true, payment is due upon receipt (eBay generates a receipt when the buyer agrees to purchase an item). The items will be available for other buyers until the payment is complete.

Note: This container can be used for sellers who opt-in to the managed payments program, but some requirements do not apply.Default: False

	// A free-form string field that allows sellers to add detailed payment instructions to their listings. The payment instructions appear on eBay's View Item and Checkout pages. eBay recommends sellers use this field to clarify payment policies for motor vehicle listings on eBay Motors. For example, sellers can include the specifics on the deposit (if required), pickup/delivery arrangements, and full payment details on the vehicle. The field allows only 500 characters as input, but due to the way the eBay web site UI treats characters, this field can return more than 500 characters in the response. For example, characters like &amp; and ' (ampersand and single quote) count as 5 characters each. Restriction: This container is not supported for sellers who opt-in to the managed payments program. Max length: 1000
	PaymentInstructions *string `json:"paymentInstructions,omitempty"`
	// If the seller is not opted-in to managed payments, this container returns a list of the payment methods accepted by the seller.

	// A unique eBay-assigned ID for a payment policy. This ID is generated when the policy is created.
	PaymentPolicyID *string `json:"paymentPolicyId,omitempty"`
