The calculations for years and months are based on a 730-hour (2,628,000-second) month. For durations longer than one month (2,628,000 seconds), the duration is rounded up to the next month, so the estimate shows you the costs for full months. For example, a duration of 3,232,800 seconds (roughly 5 weeks) is rounded up to 2 months."""
