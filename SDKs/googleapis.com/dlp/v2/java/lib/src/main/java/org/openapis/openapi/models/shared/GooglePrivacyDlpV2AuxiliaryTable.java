 * GooglePrivacyDlpV2AuxiliaryTable - An auxiliary table contains statistical information on the relative frequency of different quasi-identifiers values. It has one or several quasi-identifiers columns, and one column that indicates the relative frequency of each quasi-identifier tuple. If a tuple is present in the data but not in the auxiliary table, the corresponding relative frequency is assumed to be zero (and thus, the tuple is highly reidentifiable).
