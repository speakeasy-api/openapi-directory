/**
 * RelativeAggregationDuration - &lt;p&gt;Specifies the time window that utterance statistics are returned for. The time window is always relative to the last time that the that utterances were aggregated. For example, if the &lt;code&gt;ListAggregatedUtterances&lt;/code&gt; operation is called at 1600, the time window is set to 1 hour, and the last refresh time was 1530, only utterances made between 1430 and 1530 are returned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can choose the time window that statistics should be returned for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hours&lt;/b&gt; - You can request utterance statistics for 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hour time windows. Statistics are refreshed every half hour for 1 hour time windows, and hourly for the other time windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Days&lt;/b&gt; - You can request utterance statistics for 3 days. Statistics are refreshed every 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Weeks&lt;/b&gt; - You can see statistics for one or two weeks. Statistics are refreshed every 12 hours for one week time windows, and once per day for two week time windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
