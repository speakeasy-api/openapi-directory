    - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
      All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
    - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
      Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
    - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
      Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
    - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
      Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
    - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
      Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
