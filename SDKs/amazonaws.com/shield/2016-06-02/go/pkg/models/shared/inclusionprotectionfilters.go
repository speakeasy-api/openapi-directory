You can retrieve a single protection by providing its name or the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of its protected resource. You can also retrieve all protections for a specific resource type. You can provide up to one criteria per filter type. Shield Advanced returns protections that exactly match all of the filter criteria that you provide.
