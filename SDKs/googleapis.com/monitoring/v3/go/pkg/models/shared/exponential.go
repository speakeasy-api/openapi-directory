// Exponential - Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is proportional to the value of the lower bound. Each bucket represents a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): scale * (growth_factor ^ i). Lower bound (1 <= i < N): scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).
type Exponential struct {
	// Must be greater than 1.
	GrowthFactor *float64 `json:"growthFactor,omitempty"`
	// Must be greater than 0.
	NumFiniteBuckets *int `json:"numFiniteBuckets,omitempty"`
	// Must be greater than 0.
	Scale *float64 `json:"scale,omitempty"`
