type GetListingSetPathParams struct {
	// This path parameter takes a concatenation of the ID of the promotion you want to get plus the marketplace ID on which the promotion is hosted. Concatenate the two values by separating them with an &quot;at sign&quot; (@). The ID of the promotion (promotionId) is a unique eBay-assigned value that's generated when the promotion is created. The Marketplace ID is the ENUM value of eBay marketplace where the promotion is hosted. Example: 1********5@EBAY_US
	PromotionID string `pathParam:"style=simple,explode=false,name=promotion_id"`
}

type GetListingSetQueryParams struct {
	// Specifies the maximum number of promotions returned on a page from the result set. Default: 200 Maximum: 200
	Limit *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=limit"`
	// Specifies the number of promotions to skip in the result set before returning the first promotion in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0
	Offset *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=offset"`
	// Reserved for future use.
	Q *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=q"`
	// Specifies the order in which to sort the associated listings in the response. If you precede the supplied value with a dash, the response is sorted in reverse order. Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort=PRICE - Sorts the associated listings by their current price in ascending order &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort=-TITLE - Sorts the associated listings by their title in descending alphabetical order (Z-Az-a) Valid values: AVAILABLE PRICE TITLE For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/marketing/types/csb:SortField
	Sort *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=sort"`
	// This query parameter applies only to markdown promotions. It filters the response based on the indicated status of the promotion. Currently, the only supported value for this parameter is MARKED_DOWN, which indicates active markdown promotions. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/marketing/types/sme:ItemMarkdownStatusEnum
	Status *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=status"`
