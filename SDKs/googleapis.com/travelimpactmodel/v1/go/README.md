### flights

* `TravelimpactmodelFlightsComputeFlightEmissions` - Stateless method to retrieve emission estimates. Details on how emission estimates are computed: https://github.com/google/travel-impact-model The response will contain all entries that match the input flight legs, in the same order. If there are no estimates available for a certain flight leg, the response will return the flight leg object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered successful. Reasons for missing emission estimates include: - The flight is unknown to the server. - The input flight leg is missing one or more identifiers. - The flight date is in the past. - The aircraft type is not supported by the model. - Missing seat configuration. The request can contain up to 1000 flight legs. If the request has more than 1000 direct flights, if will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
