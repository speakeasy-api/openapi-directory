When this value is <code>request</code>, the Spot Fleet only places the required requests. It does not attempt to replenish Spot Instances if capacity is diminished, nor does it submit requests in alternative Spot pools if capacity is not available. When this value is <code>maintain</code>, the Spot Fleet maintains the target capacity. The Spot Fleet places the required requests to meet capacity and automatically replenishes any interrupted instances. Default: <code>maintain</code>. <code>instant</code> is listed but is not used by Spot Fleet. */
