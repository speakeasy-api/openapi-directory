/**
 * CreateJobRequestBodyTargetSelectionEnum - &lt;p&gt;Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive the job execution even after the job has been created.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt;
