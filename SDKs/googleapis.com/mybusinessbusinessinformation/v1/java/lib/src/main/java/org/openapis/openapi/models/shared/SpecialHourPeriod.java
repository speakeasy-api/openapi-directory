/**
 * SpecialHourPeriod - Represents a single time period when a location's operational hours differ from its normal business hours. A special hour period must represent a range of less than 24 hours. The `open_time` and `start_date` must predate the `close_time` and `end_date`. The `close_time` and `end_date` can extend to 11:59 a.m. on the day after the specified `start_date`. For example, the following inputs are valid: start_date=2015-11-23, open_time=08:00, close_time=18:00 start_date=2015-11-23, end_date=2015-11-23, open_time=08:00, close_time=18:00 start_date=2015-11-23, end_date=2015-11-24, open_time=13:00, close_time=11:59 The following inputs are not valid: start_date=2015-11-23, open_time=13:00, close_time=11:59 start_date=2015-11-23, end_date=2015-11-24, open_time=13:00, close_time=12:00 start_date=2015-11-23, end_date=2015-11-25, open_time=08:00, close_time=18:00
