"""Contains the list of servers available to the SDK"""

class SDK:
    r"""A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.
    
    For more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts).
    ## Authentication
    To use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).
    
    Both of these API credentials must be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).The following example shows how to authenticate your request when submitting a payout:
    
    ```
    curl
    -U \"storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    ...
    ```
    
    ## Versioning
    Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.
    
    For example:
    ```
    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v40/payout
    ```
    
    ## Going live
    
    To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.
    
    The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:
    ```
    
    https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v40/payout
    ```
    
    Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.
