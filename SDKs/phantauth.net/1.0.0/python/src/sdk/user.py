    To use PhantAuth as an OpenID Connect provider, you don't need to carry out the user-related operations described here.
    You don't need to generate users in advance. If PhantAuth requires a piece of data that belongs to a specific user, it will be generated in runtime.
    The deterministic nature of the generators guarantee that the same user object will be generated to the same user name.
    The only exception is selfie token generation, when the provided user data are used to create a so-called selfie token, which can later be used as a login name.

        Use this endpoint to generate a random user. The user is generated in a deterministic way, on the bases of the user name given as a path parameter.
        In the case of identical user names, the endpoint will generate the same user object. The properties of the generated user object are randomly generated on the basis of the user name.
        In lack of a user name, all calls generate a different user object to the randomly generated user name.
        
        By providing an email address as the `username` parameter, you can customize the user picture by the use of the gravatar associated with the email address.
        
        If the `username` parameter contains at least one dot (`.`) or space (` `) character, the whole name is produced from the parameter, rather than being generated.
        In this case, these cahracters play the role of separator between the units of the full name (family name, given name).`
        
        The result is always a user object. If you want to generate multiple users in one single step, you can do it by the use of *Team* generation.
        The members of a team are users randomly generated from the team name.
