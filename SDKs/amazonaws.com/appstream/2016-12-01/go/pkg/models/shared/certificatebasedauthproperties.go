// CertificateBasedAuthProperties - The certificate-based authentication properties used to authenticate SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities to Active Directory domain-joined streaming instances. Fallback is turned on by default when certificate-based authentication is <b>Enabled</b> . Fallback allows users to log in using their AD domain password if certificate-based authentication is unsuccessful, or to unlock a desktop lock screen. <b>Enabled_no_directory_login_fallback</b> enables certificate-based authentication, but does not allow users to log in using their AD domain password. Users will be disconnected to re-authenticate using certificates.
type CertificateBasedAuthProperties struct {
	CertificateAuthorityArn *string                         `json:"CertificateAuthorityArn,omitempty"`
	Status                  *CertificateBasedAuthStatusEnum `json:"Status,omitempty"`
}
