     * When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetResult's "state" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible "state" values when compare_duration is specified: * "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present before compare_duration, but present at read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state is "UNUSED", which indicates that the asset is present at read_time.
