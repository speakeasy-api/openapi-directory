 * TimeSeriesMetricKindEnum - The metric kind of the time series.

If present, it must be the same as the metric kind of the associated metric. If the associated metric's descriptor must be auto-created, then this field specifies the metric kind of the new descriptor and must be either GAUGE (the default) or CUMULATIVE.
