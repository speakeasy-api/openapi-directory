// DestinyDestinyItemQuantity - Used in a number of Destiny contracts to return data about an item stack and its quantity. Can optionally return an itemInstanceId if the item is instanced - in which case, the quantity returned will be 1. If it's not... uh, let me know okay? Thanks.
type DestinyDestinyItemQuantity struct {
	// Indicates that this item quantity may be conditionally shown or hidden, based on various sources of state. For example: server flags, account state, or character progress.
	HasConditionalVisibility *bool
	// The hash identifier for the item in question. Use it to look up the item's DestinyInventoryItemDefinition.

	ItemInstanceID *int64
	// The amount of the item needed/available depending on the context of where DestinyItemQuantity is being used.
