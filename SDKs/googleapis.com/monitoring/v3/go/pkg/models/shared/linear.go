// Linear - Specifies a linear sequence of buckets that all have the same width (except overflow and underflow). Each bucket represents a constant absolute uncertainty on the specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): offset + (width * i). Lower bound (1 <= i < N): offset + (width * (i - 1)).
type Linear struct {
	// Must be greater than 0.
	NumFiniteBuckets *int `json:"numFiniteBuckets,omitempty"`
	// Lower bound of the first bucket.
	Offset *float64 `json:"offset,omitempty"`
	// Must be greater than 0.
	Width *float64 `json:"width,omitempty"`
