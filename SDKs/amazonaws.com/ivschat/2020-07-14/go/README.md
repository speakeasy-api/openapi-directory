## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `CreateChatToken` - <p>Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.</p> <p>Use the <code>capabilities</code> field to permit an end user to send messages or moderate a room.</p> <p>The <code>attributes</code> field securely attaches structured data to the chat session; the data is included within each message sent by the end user and received by other participants in the room. Common use cases for attributes include passing end-user profile data like an icon, display name, colors, badges, and other display features.</p> <p>Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your application.</p>
* `CreateLoggingConfiguration` - Creates a logging configuration that allows clients to store and record sent messages.
* `CreateRoom` - Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.
* `DeleteLoggingConfiguration` - Deletes the specified logging configuration.
* `DeleteMessage` - Sends an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s chat history. This event’s <code>EventName</code> is <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>. This replicates the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html"> DeleteMessage</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.
* `DeleteRoom` - Deletes the specified room.
* `DisconnectUser` - Disconnects all connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html"> DisconnectUser</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.
* `GetLoggingConfiguration` - Gets the specified logging configuration.
* `GetRoom` - Gets the specified room.
* `ListLoggingConfigurations` - Gets summary information about all your logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is processed.
* `ListRooms` - Gets summary information about all your rooms in the AWS region where the API request is processed. Results are sorted in descending order of <code>updateTime</code>.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.
* `SendEvent` - Sends an event to a room. Use this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is rendered.
* `TagResource` - Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN.
* `UntagResource` - Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.
* `UpdateLoggingConfiguration` - Updates a specified logging configuration.
* `UpdateRoom` - Updates a room’s configuration.
