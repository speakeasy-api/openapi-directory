// UpdateParagraphStyleRequest - Update the styling of all paragraphs that overlap with the given range.
type UpdateParagraphStyleRequest struct {
	// The fields that should be updated. At least one field must be specified. The root `paragraph_style` is implied and should not be specified. A single `"*"` can be used as short-hand for listing every field. For example, to update the paragraph style's alignment property, set `fields` to `"alignment"`. To reset a property to its default value, include its field name in the field mask but leave the field itself unset.
	Fields *string `json:"fields,omitempty"`
	// Styles that apply to a whole paragraph. Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message. A paragraph style's parent depends on where the paragraph style is defined: * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph inherits from the paragraph's corresponding named style type. * The ParagraphStyle on a named style inherits from the normal text named style. * The ParagraphStyle of the normal text named style inherits from the default paragraph style in the Docs editor. * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph element that's contained in a table may inherit its paragraph style from the table style. If the paragraph style does not inherit from a parent, unsetting fields will revert the style to a value matching the defaults in the Docs editor.
	ParagraphStyle *ParagraphStyle `json:"paragraphStyle,omitempty"`
	// Specifies a contiguous range of text.
	Range *Range `json:"range,omitempty"`
