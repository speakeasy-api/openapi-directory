    r"""Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in the bucket to include. Included files are those that match at least one item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`. Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For example, given the input `{bucket_name: \\"mybucket\\", include_regex: [\\"directory1/.*\\"], exclude_regex: [\\"directory1/excluded.*\\"]}`: * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*` matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the full path doesn't match any items in `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [\\".*\\"]`). Some other common use cases: * `{bucket_name: \\"mybucket\\", exclude_regex: [\\".*\.pdf\\"]}` will include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name: \\"mybucket\\", include_regex: [\\"directory/[^/]+\\"]}` will include all files directly under `gs://mybucket/directory/`, without matching across `/`"""

    r"""The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format `gs:///`. Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed. If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that `gs://mybucket/` is equivalent to `gs://mybucket/*`, and `gs://mybucket/directory/` is equivalent to `gs://mybucket/directory/*`. Exactly one of `url` or `regex_file_set` must be set."""
