 * Items are instanced if they require information or state that can vary. For instance, weapons are Instanced: they are given a unique identifier, uniquely generated stats, and can have their properties altered. Non-instanced items have none of these things: for instance, Glimmer has no unique properties aside from how much of it you own.
 * You can tell from an item's definition whether it will be instanced or not by looking at the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition's definition.inventory.isInstanceItem property.
