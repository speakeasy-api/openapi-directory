     *     An authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been created successfully.
     *   * 'psuIdentified':
     *     The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified.
     *   * 'psuAuthenticated':
     *     The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified and authenticated e.g. by a password or by an access token.
     *   * 'scaMethodSelected':
     *     The PSU/TPP has selected the related SCA routine.
     *     If the SCA method is chosen implicitly since only one SCA method is available,
     *     then this is the first status to be reported instead of 'received'.
     *   * 'unconfirmed':
     *     SCA is technically successfully finalised by the PSU, but the authorisation resource needs a confirmation command by the TPP yet. 
     *   * 'started':
     *     The addressed SCA routine has been started.
     *   * 'finalised':
     *     The SCA routine has been finalised successfully (including a potential confirmation command). 
     *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
     *   * 'failed':
     *     The SCA routine failed.
     *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
     *   * 'exempted':
     *     SCA was exempted for the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful.
     *     This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
