## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `DescribeServices` - Returns the metadata for one service or a list of the metadata for all services. Use this without a service code to get the service codes for all services. Use it with a service code, such as <code>AmazonEC2</code>, to get information specific to that service, such as the attribute names available for that service. For example, some of the attribute names available for EC2 are <code>volumeType</code>, <code>maxIopsVolume</code>, <code>operation</code>, <code>locationType</code>, and <code>instanceCapacity10xlarge</code>.
* `GetAttributeValues` - Returns a list of attribute values. Attributes are similar to the details in a Price List API offer file. For a list of available attributes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/reading-an-offer.html#pps-defs">Offer File Definitions</a> in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html">Billing and Cost Management User Guide</a>.
* `GetPriceListFileURL` - <p> <i> <b>This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. Your use of Amazon Web Services Price List API is subject to the Beta Service Participation terms of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">Amazon Web Services Service Terms</a> (Section 1.10).</b> </i> </p> <p>This returns the URL that you can retrieve your Price List file from. This URL is based on the <code>PriceListArn</code> and <code>FileFormat</code> that you retrieve from the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_ListPriceLists.html"> <code>ListPriceLists</code> </a> response. </p>
* `GetProducts` - Returns a list of all products that match the filter criteria.
* `ListPriceLists` - <p> <i> <b>This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. Your use of Amazon Web Services Price List API is subject to the Beta Service Participation terms of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">Amazon Web Services Service Terms</a> (Section 1.10).</b> </i> </p> <p>This returns a list of Price List references that the requester if authorized to view, given a <code>ServiceCode</code>, <code>CurrencyCode</code>, and an <code>EffectiveDate</code>. Use without a <code>RegionCode</code> filter to list Price List references from all available Amazon Web Services Regions. Use with a <code>RegionCode</code> filter to get the Price List reference that's specific to a specific Amazon Web Services Region. You can use the <code>PriceListArn</code> from the response to get your preferred Price List files through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_GetPriceListFileUrl.html"> <code>GetPriceListFileUrl</code> </a> API.</p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
