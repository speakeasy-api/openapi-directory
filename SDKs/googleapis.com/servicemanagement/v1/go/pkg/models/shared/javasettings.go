	// The package name to use in Java. Clobbers the java_package option set in the protobuf. This should be used **only** by APIs who have already set the language_settings.java.package_name" field in gapic.yaml. API teams should use the protobuf java_package option where possible. Example of a YAML configuration:: publishing: java_settings: library_package: com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1

Keys are fully-qualified service names as they appear in the protobuf (including the full the language_settings.java.interface_names" field in gapic.yaml. API teams should otherwise use the service name as it appears in the protobuf. Example of a YAML configuration:: publishing: java_settings: service_class_names: - google.pubsub.v1.Publisher: TopicAdmin - google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber: SubscriptionAdmin
