// GoogleAppsCardV1Section - A section contains a collection of widgets that are rendered vertically in the order that they are specified.
type GoogleAppsCardV1Section struct {
	// Indicates whether this section is collapsible. Collapsible sections hide some or all widgets, but users can expand the section to reveal the hidden widgets by clicking **Show more**. Users can hide the widgets again by clicking **Show less**. To determine which widgets are hidden, specify `uncollapsibleWidgetsCount`.
	Collapsible *bool `json:"collapsible,omitempty"`
	// Text that appears at the top of a section. Supports simple HTML formatted text. For more information about formatting text, see Formatting text in Google Chat apps and Formatting text in Google Workspace Add-ons.
	Header *string `json:"header,omitempty"`
	// The number of uncollapsible widgets which remain visible even when a section is collapsed. For example, when a section contains five widgets and the `uncollapsibleWidgetsCount` is set to `2`, the first two widgets are always shown and the last three are collapsed by default. The `uncollapsibleWidgetsCount` is taken into account only when `collapsible` is `true`.
	UncollapsibleWidgetsCount *int `json:"uncollapsibleWidgetsCount,omitempty"`
	// All the widgets in the section. Must contain at least 1 widget.
