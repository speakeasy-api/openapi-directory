Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.
	Previous *string `json:"previous,omitempty"`
	// Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute.
	Size   *int64                   `json:"size,omitempty"`
