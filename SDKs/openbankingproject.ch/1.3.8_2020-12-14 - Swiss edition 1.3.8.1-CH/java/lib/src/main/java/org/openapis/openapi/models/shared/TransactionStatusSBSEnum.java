/**
 * TransactionStatusSBSEnum - The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table.
 * Only the codes RCVD, PATC, ACTC, ACWC and RJCT are used:
 * - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
 *   All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
 * - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
 *   Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
 * - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
 *   Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
 * - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
 *   Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
 * - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
 *   Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
