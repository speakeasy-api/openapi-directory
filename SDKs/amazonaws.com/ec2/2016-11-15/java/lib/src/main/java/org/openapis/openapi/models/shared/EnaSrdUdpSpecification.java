/**
 * EnaSrdUdpSpecification - ENA Express is compatible with both TCP and UDP transport protocols. When it\u2019s enabled, TCP traffic automatically uses it. However, some UDP-based applications are designed to handle network packets that are out of order, without a need for retransmission, such as live video broadcasting or other near-real-time applications. For UDP traffic, you can specify whether to use ENA Express, based on your application environment needs.
