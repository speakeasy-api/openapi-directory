### SDK SDK

* `createToken` - Creates and returns an access token for the authorized client. The access token issued will be used to fetch short-term credentials for the assigned roles in the AWS account.
* `registerClient` - Registers a client with IAM Identity Center. This allows clients to initiate device authorization. The output should be persisted for reuse through many authentication requests.
* `startDeviceAuthorization` - Initiates device authorization by requesting a pair of verification codes from the authorization service.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
