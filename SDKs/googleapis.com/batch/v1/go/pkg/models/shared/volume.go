// Volume - Volume describes a volume and parameters for it to be mounted to a VM.
type Volume struct {
	// Device name of an attached disk volume, which should align with a device_name specified by job.allocation_policy.instances[0].policy.disks[i].device_name or defined by the given instance template in job.allocation_policy.instances[0].instance_template.

	// Represents a Google Cloud Storage volume.
	Gcs *Gcs `json:"gcs,omitempty"`
	// For Google Cloud Storage (GCS), mount options are the options supported by the gcsfuse tool (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse). For existing persistent disks, mount options provided by the mount command (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html) except writing are supported. This is due to restrictions of multi-writer mode (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms). For other attached disks and Network File System (NFS), mount options are these supported by the mount command (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html).
	MountOptions []string `json:"mountOptions,omitempty"`
	// The mount path for the volume, e.g. /mnt/disks/share.
	MountPath *string `json:"mountPath,omitempty"`
	// Represents an NFS volume.
	Nfs *Nfs `json:"nfs,omitempty"`
