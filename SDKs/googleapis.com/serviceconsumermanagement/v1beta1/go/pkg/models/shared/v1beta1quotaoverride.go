// V1Beta1QuotaOverride - A quota override
type V1Beta1QuotaOverride struct {
	// The resource name of the ancestor that requested the override. For example: "organizations/12345" or "folders/67890". Used by admin overrides only.
	AdminOverrideAncestor *string `json:"adminOverrideAncestor,omitempty"`
	//  If this map is nonempty, then this override applies only to specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit. For example, an override on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region} could contain an entry with the key "region" and the value "us-east-1"; the override is only applied to quota consumed in that region. This map has the following restrictions: * Keys that are not defined in the limit's unit are not valid keys. Any string appearing in {brackets} in the unit (besides {project} or {user}) is a defined key. * "project" is not a valid key; the project is already specified in the parent resource name. * "user" is not a valid key; the API does not support quota overrides that apply only to a specific user. * If "region" appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region. * If "zone" appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone. * If any valid key other than "region" or "zone" appears in the map, then all valid keys other than "region" or "zone" must also appear in the map.
	Dimensions map[string]string `json:"dimensions,omitempty"`
	// The name of the metric to which this override applies. An example name would be: `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
	Metric *string `json:"metric,omitempty"`

	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The overriding quota limit value. Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
	OverrideValue *string `json:"overrideValue,omitempty"`
	// The limit unit of the limit to which this override applies. An example unit would be: `1/{project}/{region}` Note that `{project}` and `{region}` are not placeholders in this example; the literal characters `{` and `}` occur in the string.
	Unit *string `json:"unit,omitempty"`
