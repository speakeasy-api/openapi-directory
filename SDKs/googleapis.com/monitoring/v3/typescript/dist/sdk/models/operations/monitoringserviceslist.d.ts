     * A filter specifying what Services to return. The filter supports filtering on a particular service-identifier type or one of its attributes.To filter on a particular service-identifier type, the identifier_case refers to which option in the identifier field is populated. For example, the filter identifier_case = "CUSTOM" would match all services with a value for the custom field. Valid options include "CUSTOM", "APP_ENGINE", "MESH_ISTIO", and the other options listed at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#ServiceTo filter on an attribute of a service-identifier type, apply the filter name by using the snake case of the service-identifier type and the attribute of that service-identifier type, and join the two with a period. For example, to filter by the meshUid field of the MeshIstio service-identifier type, you must filter on mesh_istio.mesh_uid = "123" to match all services with mesh UID "123". Service-identifier types and their attributes are described at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#Service
