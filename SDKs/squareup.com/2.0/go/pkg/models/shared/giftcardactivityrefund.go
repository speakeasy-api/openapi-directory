type GiftCardActivityRefund struct {
	// Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.
	// Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are
	// considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the
	// sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See
	// [Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)
	// for more information.

	// When the Square Payments API is used, Refund is not called on the Gift Cards API.
	// However, when Square reads a Refund activity from the Gift Cards API, the developer needs to know the
	// ID of the payment (made using this gift card) that is being refunded.
	PaymentID *string `json:"payment_id,omitempty"`
	// The ID for the Redeem activity that needs to be refunded. Hence, the activity it
	// refers to has to be of the REDEEM type.
	RedeemActivityID string `json:"redeem_activity_id"`
	// A client-specified ID to associate an entity, in another system, with this gift card
	// activity. This can be used to track the order or payment related information when the Square Orders
	// API is not being used.
	ReferenceID *string `json:"reference_id,omitempty"`
