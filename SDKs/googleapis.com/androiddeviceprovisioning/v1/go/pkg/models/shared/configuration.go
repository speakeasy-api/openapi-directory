// ConfigurationInput - A configuration collects the provisioning options for Android devices. Each configuration combines the following: * The EMM device policy controller (DPC) installed on the devices. * EMM policies enforced on the devices. * Metadata displayed on the device to help users during setup. Customers can add as many configurations as they need. However, zero-touch enrollment works best when a customer sets a default configuration that's applied to any new devices the organization purchases.
type ConfigurationInput struct {
	// Required. The name of the organization. Zero-touch enrollment shows this organization name to device users during device provisioning.
	CompanyName *string `json:"companyName,omitempty"`
	// Required. A short name that describes the configuration's purpose. For example, _Sales team_ or _Temporary employees_. The zero-touch enrollment portal displays this name to IT admins.
	ConfigurationName *string `json:"configurationName,omitempty"`
	// Required. The email address that device users can contact to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this email address to device users before device provisioning. The value is validated on input.
	ContactEmail *string `json:"contactEmail,omitempty"`
	// Required. The telephone number that device users can call, using another device, to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this number to device users before device provisioning. Accepts numerals, spaces, the plus sign, hyphens, and parentheses.
	ContactPhone *string `json:"contactPhone,omitempty"`
	// A message, containing one or two sentences, to help device users get help or give them more details about what’s happening to their device. Zero-touch enrollment shows this message before the device is provisioned.
	CustomMessage *string `json:"customMessage,omitempty"`
	// The JSON-formatted EMM provisioning extras that are passed to the DPC.
	DpcExtras *string `json:"dpcExtras,omitempty"`
	// Required. The resource name of the selected DPC (device policy controller) in the format `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/dpcs/*`. To list the supported DPCs, call `customers.dpcs.list`.
	DpcResourcePath *string `json:"dpcResourcePath,omitempty"`
	// Required. Whether this is the default configuration that zero-touch enrollment applies to any new devices the organization purchases in the future. Only one customer configuration can be the default. Setting this value to `true`, changes the previous default configuration's `isDefault` value to `false`.
	IsDefault *bool `json:"isDefault,omitempty"`
