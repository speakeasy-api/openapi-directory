This value will be used to populate the placements.vpaidAdapterChoice field, when no value is specified for the new placement. Controls which VPAID format the measurement adapter will use for in-stream video creatives assigned to the placement. The publisher's specifications will typically determine this setting. For VPAID creatives, the adapter format will match the VPAID format (HTML5 VPAID creatives use the HTML5 adapter). *Note:* Flash is no longer supported. This field now defaults to HTML5 when the following values are provided: FLASH, BOTH. */
