	//
	// `"tel"` - Telephone-Initiated Entry
	//
	// `"web"` - Internet-Initiated Entry - debits from a consumerâ€™s account where their authorization is obtained over the Internet

	// The amount of the transfer (decimal string with two digits of precision e.g. "10.00").

	BeaconSessionID *string `json:"beacon_session_id,omitempty"`

	//
	// The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. For example, if a request to create an authorization fails due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single authorization is created.
	//
	// Failure to provide this key may result in duplicate charges.
	//
	// Required for guaranteed ACH customers.
	IdempotencyKey *string `json:"idempotency_key,omitempty"`

	// For transfers submitted as either `ach` or `same-day-ach` the cutoff for same-day is 9:30 AM Pacific Time and the cutoff for next-day transfers is 5:30 PM Pacific Time. It is recommended to submit a transfer at least 15 minutes before the cutoff time in order to ensure that it will be processed before the cutoff. Any transfer that is indicated as `same-day-ach` and that misses the same-day cutoff, but is submitted in time for the next-day cutoff, will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges. Note that both legs of the transfer will be downgraded if applicable.

	Secret *string `json:"secret,omitempty"`
	// The type of transfer. This will be either `debit` or `credit`.  A `debit` indicates a transfer of money into the origination account; a `credit` indicates a transfer of money out of the origination account.
	Type TransferTypeEnum `json:"type"`
	// The legal name and other information for the account holder.
	User map[string]interface{} `json:"user"`
	// Required for Guarantee. If the end user is initiating the specific transfer themselves via an interactive UI, this should be `true`; for automatic recurring payments where the end user is not actually initiating each individual transfer, it should be `false`.

	// If set to `false`, Plaid will not offer a `guarantee_decision` for this request(Guarantee customers only).
	WithGuarantee *bool `json:"with_guarantee,omitempty"`
