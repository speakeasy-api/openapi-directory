## SDK Installation

### Composer

To install the SDK first add the below to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
composer update
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

## SDK Example Usage
<!-- Start SDK Example Usage -->
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use \OpenAPI\OpenAPI\SDK;
use \OpenAPI\OpenAPI\Models\Operations\GkehubProjectsLocationsListRequest;
use \OpenAPI\OpenAPI\Models\Shared\XgafvEnum;
use \OpenAPI\OpenAPI\Models\Shared\AltEnum;
use \OpenAPI\OpenAPI\Models\Operations\GkehubProjectsLocationsListSecurity;

$sdk = SDK::builder()
    ->build();

try {
    $request = new GkehubProjectsLocationsListRequest();
    $request->dollarXgafv = XgafvEnum::TWO;
    $request->accessToken = 'provident';
    $request->alt = AltEnum::PROTO;
    $request->callback = 'quibusdam';
    $request->fields = 'unde';
    $request->filter = 'nulla';
    $request->key = 'corrupti';
    $request->name = 'Ben Mueller';

    $requestSecurity = new GkehubProjectsLocationsListSecurity();
    $requestSecurity->oauth2 = 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE';
    $requestSecurity->oauth2c = 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE';

    $response = $sdk->projects->gkehubProjectsLocationsList($request, $requestSecurity);

    if ($response->listLocationsResponse !== null) {
        // handle response
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // handle exception

## Available Resources and Operations


### [projects](docs/projects/README.md)

* [gkehubProjectsLocationsList](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationslist) - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationscancel) - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsGet](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationsget) - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsList](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationslist) - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
