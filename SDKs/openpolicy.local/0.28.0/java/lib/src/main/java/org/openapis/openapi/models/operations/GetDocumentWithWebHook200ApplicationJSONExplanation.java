     * - enter - before a body or rule is evaluated
     * - exit - after a body or rule has evaluated successfully
     * - eval - before an expression is evaluated
     * - fail - after an expression has evaluated to false.
     * - redo - before evaluation restarts from a body, rule, or expression.
     * 
     * By default, OPA searches for all sets of term bindings that make all expressions in the query evaluate to true. Because there may be multiple answers, the search can restart when OPA determines the query is true or false. When the search restarts, a *redo trace event* is emitted.
