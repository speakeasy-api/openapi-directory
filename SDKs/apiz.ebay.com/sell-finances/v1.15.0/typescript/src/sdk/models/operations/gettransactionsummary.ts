   * Numerous filters are available for the <strong>getTransactionSummary</strong> method, and these filters are discussed below. One or more of these filter types can be used. The <b>transactionStatus</b> filter must be used. All other filters are optional. <ul><li><b>transactionStatus</b>: the data returned in the response pertains to the sales, payouts, and transfer status set. The supported <b>transactionStatus</b> values are as follows:<ul><li><code>PAYOUT</code>: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) have been paid out to the seller's bank account.</li><li><code>FUNDS_PROCESSING</code>: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are currently being processed.</li><li><code>FUNDS_AVAILABLE_FOR_PAYOUT</code>: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are available for a seller payout, but processing has not yet begun.</li><li><code>FUNDS_ON_HOLD</code>: only consider monetary transactions where the proceeds from the sales order(s) are currently being held by eBay, and are not yet available for a seller payout.</li><li><code>COMPLETED</code>: this indicates that the funds for the corresponding <code>TRANSFER</code> monetary transaction have transferred and the transaction has completed.</li><li><code>FAILED</code>: this indicates the process has failed for the corresponding <code>TRANSFER</code> monetary transaction. </li></ul>Below is the proper syntax to use when setting up the <b>transactionStatus</b> filter: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionStatus:&#123;PAYOUT&#125;</code></li><li><b>transactionDate</b>: only consider monetary transactions that occurred within a specific range of dates.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> All dates must be input using UTC format (<code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ</code>) and should be adjusted accordingly for the local timezone of the user.</span><br><br>Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=transactionDate:&#91;2018-10-23T00:00:01.000Z..2018-11-09T00:00:01.000Z&#93;</code><br><br>Alternatively, the user could omit the ending date, and the date range would include the starting date and up to 90 days past that date, or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past.</li>  <li><b>transactionType</b>: only consider a specific type of monetary transaction. The supported <b>transactionType</b> values are as follows:<ul><li><code>SALE</code>: a sales order.</li><li> <code>REFUND</code>: a refund to the buyer after an order cancellation or return.</li><li><code>CREDIT</code>: a credit issued by eBay to the seller's account.</li><li><code>DISPUTE</code>: a monetary transaction associated with a payment dispute between buyer and seller.</li><li><code>NON_SALE_CHARGE</code>: a monetary transaction involving a seller transferring money to eBay for the balance of a charge for NON_SALE_CHARGE transactions (transactions that contain non-transactional seller fees). These can include a one-time payment, monthly/yearly subscription fees charged monthly, NRC charges, and fee credits.</li><li><code>SHIPPING_LABEL</code>: a monetary transaction where eBay is billing the seller for an eBay shipping label. Note that the shipping label functionality will initially only be available to a select number of sellers.</li><li><code>TRANSFER</code>: A transfer is a monetary transaction where eBay is billing the seller for reimbursement of a charge. An example of a transfer is a seller reimbursing eBay for a buyer refund.</li><li><code>ADJUSTMENT</code>: An adjustment is a monetary transaction where eBay is crediting or debiting the seller's account.</li><li><code>WITHDRAWAL</code>: A withdrawal is a monetary transaction where the seller requests an on-demand payout from eBay.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b> On-demand payout is not available for sellers who are already on a <b>daily</b> payout schedule. In order to initiate an on-demand payout, a seller must be on a <b>weekly</b>, <b>bi-weekly</b>, or <b>monthly</b> payout schedule.</span></li><li><code>LOAN_REPAYMENT</code>: A monetary transaction related to the repayment of an outstanding loan balance for approved participants enrolled in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/sellercapital/ " target="_blank ">eBay Seller Capital financing program</a>.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b> eBay Seller Capital financing is only available in select marketplaces.

So, this filter will only be useful to retrieve orders than occurred before this date.</span> </li><li><b>payoutId</b>: only consider monetary transactions related to a specific seller payout (identified with a Payout ID). This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction_summary?filter=payoutId:&#123;5********8&#125;</code>  </li><li><b>transactionId</b>: the unique identifier of a monetary transaction.
