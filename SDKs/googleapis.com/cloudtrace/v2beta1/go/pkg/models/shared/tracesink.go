The service account will need to be granted write access to the destination specified in the output configuration, see [Granting access for a resource](/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). To create tables and to write data, this account needs the `dataEditor` role. Read more about roles in the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).
