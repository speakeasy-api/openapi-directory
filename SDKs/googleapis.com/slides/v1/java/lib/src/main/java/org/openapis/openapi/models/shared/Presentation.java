The format of the revision ID may change over time, so it should be treated opaquely. A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the presentation has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same presentation and user) usually means the presentation has been updated. However, a changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes.
