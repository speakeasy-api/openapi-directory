 * PatchInstanceFilterGroupLabel - Targets a group of VM instances by using their [assigned labels](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources). Labels are key-value pairs. A `GroupLabel` is a combination of labels that is used to target VMs for a patch job. For example, a patch job can target VMs that have the following `GroupLabel`: `{"env":"test", "app":"web"}`. This means that the patch job is applied to VMs that have both the labels `env=test` and `app=web`.
