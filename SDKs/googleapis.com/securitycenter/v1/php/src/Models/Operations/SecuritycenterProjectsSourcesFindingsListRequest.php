This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time.

Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
