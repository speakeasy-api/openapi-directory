## Overview


The VTEX Headless CMS is a no-code management system for storefront content. 
That means you can store your content as structured data in a layer decoupled from the frontend and 
use the VTEX Headless CMS to access and deliver your content to your storefront project.

Notice that the VTEX Headless CMS typically works with **FastStore** projects only. In this case, you can use this API
to fetch data using SSR (NextJS and Gatsby v4+) or SSG (NextJS).

**Servers**
- `https://{account}.myvtex.com/`
- `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/`

**Server variables**
- `accountName`: Name of your VTEX account.
- `workspace`: Name of your VTEX workspace.
