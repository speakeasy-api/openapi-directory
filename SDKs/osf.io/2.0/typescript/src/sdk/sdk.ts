   * Schema Response Actions are objects that when created cause state transitions for Schema Responses. Users use state transitions to submit, approve, and revise new Schema Responses.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Schema Response Actions have a  few different triggers to cause state transitions:
   *
   *   - `submit` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `in_progress` state to an `unapproved` state,
   *   this freezes edits for the Schema Response and allows all admin contributors to the Schema Response's
   *   Registration to either approved or reject the Schema Response.
   *
   *   - `approve` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an `approved` state, this
   *   makes the Schema Response changes public completing the update of the Schema Response. On Schema Responses that
   *   are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow the `approve` trigger
   *   will transition the Schema Response to `pending_moderation`.
   *
   *   - `accept` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an `approved`
   *   state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration that has
   *   Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
   *   Registration Provider.
   *
   *   - `admin_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an
   *   `in_progress`  state. This trigger allows users to reject purposed changes to a Schema Response.
   *
   *   - `moderator_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an
   *   `in_progress`  state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration
   *   that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
   *   Registration Provider.
   */
  public schemaResponseActions: SchemaResponseActions;
  /**
   * Schema Responses contain user supplied responses to a Registration Schema. A Schema Response aggregates all of the the responses for a given version of a Registration's Registration Schema. Schema Responses are created when a Registration is completed. Once a Registration is completed the Schema Responses for a Registration can be revisied and updated by using it's associated action endpoints.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * There are a few states for Schema Responses:
   *
   *   - `initial` is the state of a Schema Response on a newly registered Registration, to edit a Schema Response you
   *   must create a Schema Response Action that triggers a new submission.
   *
   *   - `in_progess` is the state of a Schema Response where the response is editable and still private, Schema
   *   Responses are editted via a PATCH request as specified below.
   *
   *   - `unapproved` is the state of a Schema Response where edits have been made and "locked-in", now contributors
   *   have the ability to reject the changes, however if they are not rejected changes are automatically approved
   *   after 48 hours. If `unapproved` Schema Responses are rejected, they are returned to the `in_progress` state. If
   *   `unapproved` Schema Responses are approved they either enter an `approved` state or go into a
   *   `pending_moderation` to be accepted or denied by a moderator.
   *
   *   - `pending_moderation` is the state of a Schema Response where moderators have an opportunity to reject or
   *   approve a Schema Response that has been approved by it's contributors. This state is only reachable for Schema
   *   Responses that are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow.
   *
   *   - `approved` is the state of a Schema Response where it is public and immutable, in order to update an approved
   *   Schema Response a new one must be created.
