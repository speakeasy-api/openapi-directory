### v3

* `playablelocationsLogImpressions` - Logs new events when playable locations are displayed, and when they are interacted with. Impressions are not partially saved; either all impressions are saved and this request succeeds, or no impressions are saved, and this request fails.
* `playablelocationsLogPlayerReports` - Logs bad playable location reports submitted by players. Reports are not partially saved; either all reports are saved and this request succeeds, or no reports are saved, and this request fails.
* `playablelocationsSamplePlayableLocations` - Returns a set of playable locations that lie within a specified area, that satisfy optional filter criteria. Note: Identical `SamplePlayableLocations` requests can return different results as the state of the world changes over time.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
