 * ProjectStatusCompact - *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the `status_update` resource.*

These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, and "red" for projects that are behind.
