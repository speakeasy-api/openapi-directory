If the event were in New York, this would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). Remember that offset varies in regions that observe Daylight Saving Time (or Summer Time), depending on the time of the year. `1985-04-12T19:20:50.52` would be 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 19th hour of April 12th, 1985 with no offset information.
