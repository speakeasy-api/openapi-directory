	// Specifies the maximum distance (in meters) a vehicle can go.
	MaxDistance *int64 `json:"max_distance,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum number of jobs a vehicle can load.
	MaxJobs *int `json:"max_jobs,omitempty"`
	// Specifies the minimum number of jobs a vehicle should load. This is a soft constraint, i.e. if it is not possible to fulfill “min_jobs”, we will still try to get as close as possible to this constraint.

	// If it is false, the algorithm decides where to end the vehicle route. It ends in one of your customers' locations. The end is chosen such that it contributes to the overall objective function, e.g. min transport_time. If it is true, you can either specify a specific end location (which is then regarded as end depot) or you can leave it and the driver returns to its start location.
	ReturnToDepot *bool `json:"return_to_depot,omitempty"`

	Skills       []string `json:"skills,omitempty"`
	StartAddress Address  `json:"start_address"`
	// The type ID assigns a vehicle type to this vehicle. You can specify types in the array of vehicle types. If you omit the type ID, the default type is used. The default type is a `car` with a capacity of 0.
	TypeID *string `json:"type_id,omitempty"`
	// Specifies the ID of the vehicle. Ids must be unique, i.e. if there are two vehicles with the same ID, an error is returned.
	VehicleID string `json:"vehicle_id"`
