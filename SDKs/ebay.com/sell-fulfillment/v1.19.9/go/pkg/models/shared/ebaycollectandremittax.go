// EbayCollectAndRemitTax - This type contains information about the type and amount of tax that eBay will collect and remit to the state, province, country, or other taxing authority in the buyer's location, as required by that taxing authority. 'Collect and Remit' tax includes US state-mandated sales tax, 'Goods and Services' tax in Australia or New Zealand, VAT collected for the UK and EU countries.
type EbayCollectAndRemitTax struct {
	// This type defines the monetary value of an amount. It can provide the amount in both the currency used on the eBay site where an item is being offered and the conversion of that value into another currency, if applicable.
	Amount *Amount `json:"amount,omitempty"`
	// This field indicates the collection method used to collect the 'Collect and Remit' tax for the order. This field is always returned for orders subject to 'Collect and Remit' tax, and its value is always NET. Note: Although the collectionMethod field is returned for all orders subject to 'Collect and Remit' tax, the collectionMethod field and the CollectionMethodEnum type are not currently of any practical use, although this field may have use in the future. If and when the logic of this field is changed, this note will be updated and a note will also be added to the Release Notes. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/fulfillment/types/sel:CollectionMethodEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
	CollectionMethod *string `json:"collectionMethod,omitempty"`
	// This type describes the VAT tax details. The eBay VAT tax type and the eBay VAT identifier number will be returned if a VAT tax is applicable for the order. Note: On January 31, 2022, the orders.fulfillmentStartInstructions.shippingStep.shipTo.contactAddress.addressLine2 will stop being used to return VAT information, so developers should make sure they integrate with the new fields before that time.
	EbayReference *EbayTaxReference `json:"ebayReference,omitempty"`
	// The type of tax and fees that eBay will collect and remit to the taxing or fee authority. See the TaxTypeEnum type definition for more information about each tax or fee type. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/fulfillment/types/sel:TaxTypeEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
