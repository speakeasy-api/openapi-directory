// Statement - Describes a reliable statement that has been made about the relationship between a source asset and a target asset. Statements are always made by the source asset, either directly or by delegating to a statement list that is stored elsewhere. For more detailed definitions of statements and assets, please refer to our [API documentation landing page](/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started).
type Statement struct {
	// The relation identifies the use of the statement as intended by the source asset's owner (that is, the person or entity who issued the statement). Every complete statement has a relation. We identify relations with strings of the format `/`, where `` must be one of a set of pre-defined purpose categories, and `` is a free-form lowercase alphanumeric string that describes the specific use case of the statement. Refer to [our API documentation](/digital-asset-links/v1/relation-strings) for the current list of supported relations. Example: `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls` REQUIRED
