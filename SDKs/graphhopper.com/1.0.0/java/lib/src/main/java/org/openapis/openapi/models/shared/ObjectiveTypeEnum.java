/**
 * ObjectiveTypeEnum - Type of objective function, i.e. `min` or `min-max`.
 * 
 *  * `min`: Minimizes the objective value.
 *  * `min-max`: Minimizes the maximum objective value.
 * 
 * For instance, `min` -&gt; `vehicles` minimizes the number of employed vehicles.
 * `min` -&gt; `completion_time` minimizes the sum of your vehicle routes' completion time.
 * 
 * If you use, for example, `min-max` -&gt; `completion_time`, it minimizes the maximum of your vehicle routes' completion time, i.e. it minimizes the overall makespan.
 * This only makes sense if you have more than one vehicle. In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.
 * If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that
 * the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours
 * to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,
 * this usually comes with higher transport costs.
 * 
 * If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:
 * 
 * ```json
 * "objectives" : [
 *    {
 *       "type": "min",
 *       "value": "vehicles"
 *    },
 *    {
 *       "type": "min",
 *       "value": "completion_time"
 *    }
 * ]
 * ```
 * 
 * If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:
 * 
 * ```json
 * "objectives" : [
 *    {
 *       "type": "min-max",
 *       "value": "completion_time"
 *    },
 *    {
 *       "type": "min-max",
 *       "value": "activities"
 *    }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
