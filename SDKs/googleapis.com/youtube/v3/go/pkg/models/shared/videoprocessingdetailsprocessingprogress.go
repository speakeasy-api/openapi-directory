type VideoProcessingDetailsProcessingProgress struct {
	// The number of parts of the video that YouTube has already processed. You can estimate the percentage of the video that YouTube has already processed by calculating: 100 * parts_processed / parts_total Note that since the estimated number of parts could increase without a corresponding increase in the number of parts that have already been processed, it is possible that the calculated progress could periodically decrease while YouTube processes a video.

	// An estimate of the total number of parts that need to be processed for the video. The number may be updated with more precise estimates while YouTube processes the video.
	PartsTotal *string `json:"partsTotal,omitempty"`
	// An estimate of the amount of time, in millseconds, that YouTube needs to finish processing the video.
	TimeLeftMs *string `json:"timeLeftMs,omitempty"`
