type Address struct {
	// The current administrative county to which the postcode has been assigned. A Unitary Authority name, where one is present. If there is no Unitary Authority, the County name is used. This information is not static, because County boundaries may change due to administrative changes. Data source: ONS. May be empty.
	AdministrativeCounty *string `json:"administrative_county,omitempty"`
	// Name of residential or commercial premise. E.g. The Manor, 1-2, A, 12A, K, Victoria House
	BuildingName *string `json:"building_name,omitempty"`
	// Number to identify premise on a thoroughfare or dependant thoroughfare.
	BuildingNumber *string `json:"building_number,omitempty"`
	// The country for which the postcode belongs to. May be empty for a small number of addresses. Data source: ONS
	Country *string `json:"country,omitempty"`
	// Since postal, administrative or traditional counties may not apply to some addresses, the county field is designed to return whatever county data is available. Normally, the postal county is returned. If this is not present, the county field will fall back to the administrative county. If the administrative county is also not present, the county field will fall back to the traditional county. May be empty in cases where no administrative, postal or traditional county present.
	County *string `json:"county,omitempty"`
	// A unique Royal Mail 2-character code (the first numeric & the second alphabetical), which, when added to the Postcode, enables each live Delivery Point to be uniquely identified. Once the Delivery Point is deleted from PAF the DPS may be reused (although they aren’t reused until all remaining Delivery Points in the range have been allocated). The DPS for a Large User is always '1A' as each Large User has its own Postcode. E.g. 2B
	DeliveryPointSuffix *string `json:"delivery_point_suffix,omitempty"`
	// Used to supplment Organisation Name to identify a deparment within the organisation.
	DepartmentName *string `json:"department_name,omitempty"`
	// When the same thoroughfare name reoccurs in a Post town, it may not be possible to make it dependant on a dependant thoroughfare. In this case the thoroughfare is dependant on a locality. For example if we want to find 1 Back Lane in Huddersfield we see that there are three.
	DependentLocality *string `json:"dependent_locality,omitempty"`
	// Used to supplement thoroughfare. When a thoroughfare name is used twice in the same Post Town, the dependant thoroughfare is added to uniquely indentify a delivery point.
	DependentThoroughfare *string `json:"dependent_thoroughfare,omitempty"`
	// The current district/unitary authority to which the postcode has been assigned. Data source: ONS
	District *string `json:"district,omitempty"`
	// Used to supplement Dependant Locality. A Double Dependant Locality supplied along with a Dependant Locality if the Dependant Locality exists twice in the same locality.
	DoubleDependentLocality *string `json:"double_dependent_locality,omitempty"`
	// Eastings reference using the Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system. Northern Ireland Eastings uses the Irish Grid Reference System. Metres from origin. E.g. 550458. Returns an empty string if no location data is available. Otherwise a number is returned
	Eastings *int `json:"eastings,omitempty"`
	// The latitude of the postcode (WGS84/ETRS89). Accurate at the postcode level Can be a positive or negative decimal. E.g. 51.5083983. Returns an empty string if no location data is available. Otherwise a number is returned
	Latitude *float64 `json:"latitude,omitempty"`
	// First Address Line. Often contains premise and thoroughfare information. In the case of a commercial premise, the first line is always the full name of the registered organisation. Never empty.
	Line1 *string `json:"line_1,omitempty"`
	// Second Address Line. Often contains thoroughfare and locality information. May be empty.
	Line2 *string `json:"line_2,omitempty"`
	// Third address line. May be empty.
	Line3 *string `json:"line_3,omitempty"`
	// The longitude of the postcode (WGS84/ETRS89). Accurate at the postcode level. Can be a positive or negative decimal. E.g. -0.1283983. Returns an empty string if no location data is available. Otherwise, a number is returned
	Longitude *float64 `json:"longitude,omitempty"`
	// Northings reference using the Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system. Northern Ireland Northings uses the Irish Grid Reference System. Metres from origin. E.g. 180458. Returns an empty string if no location data is available. Otherwise a number is returned

	// Name of the organisation registered at this address.
	OrganisationName *string `json:"organisation_name,omitempty"`
	// When the PO Box Number field is populated it will contain PO BOX nnnnnn where n represents the PO Box number. Note that the PO Box details can occasionally consist of a combination of numbers and letters e.g. HK860. PO Box Numbers are only allocated to Large Users.
	PoBox *string `json:"po_box,omitempty"`
	// A Post Town is mandatory for delivery of mail to a Delivery Point. This is not necessarily the nearest town geographically, but a routing instruction to the Royal Mail delivery office sorting mail for that Delivery Point. A Post Town will always be present in every address, and for some Localities the Post Town will be the only locality element present.
	PostTown *string `json:"post_town,omitempty"`
	// Postal counties were used for the distribution of mail before the Postcode system was introduced in the 1970s. The Former Postal County was the Administrative County at the time. This data rarely changes. Data source: Royal Mail. May be empty.
	PostalCounty *string `json:"postal_county,omitempty"`
	// Correctly formatted postcode. Capitalised and spaced.
	Postcode *string `json:"postcode,omitempty"`
	// The second part of a postcode is known as the inward Code. e.g. The inward code of ID1 1QD is 1QD. This part is one number followed by two letters. The number identifies the sector in the postal district. The letters then define one or more properties in that sector.
	PostcodeInward *string `json:"postcode_inward,omitempty"`
	// The first part of a postcode is known as the outward code. e.g. The outward code of ID1 1QD is ID1. Enables mail to be sorted to the correct local area for delivery. This part of the code contains the area and the district to which the mail is to be delivered, e.g. ‘PO1’, ‘SW1A’ or ‘B23’.
	PostcodeOutward *string `json:"postcode_outward,omitempty"`
	// This indicates the type of user. It can only take the values 'S' or 'L' indicating small or large respectively. Large User Postcodes. These are assigned to one single address either due to the large volume of mail received at that address, or because a PO Box or Selectapost service has been set up. Small User Postcodes. These identify a group of Delivery Points. On average there are 15 Delivery Points per Postcode. However this can vary between 1 and, in some cases, 100. There will never be more than 100 Delivery Points on a Postcode.
	PostcodeType *PostcodeTypeEnum `json:"postcode_type,omitempty"`
	// A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number, building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail's and can be difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of using our address lines data.
	Premise *string `json:"premise,omitempty"`
	// Small User Organisation Indicator can have the values 'Y' or space. A value of 'Y' indicates that a Small User Organisation is present at this address.
	SuOrganisationIndicator *string `json:"su_organisation_indicator,omitempty"`
	// When a premise is split into individual units such as flats, apartments or business units. Cannot be present without either building_name or building_number. E.g. Flat 1, A, 10B
	SubBuildingName *string `json:"sub_building_name,omitempty"`
	// Also known as the street or road name. In general each Thoroughfare Name will have a separate Postcode. Longer Thoroughfares with high number ranges often have multiple Postcodes covering the entire length of the road, with breaks at suitable points e.g. junctions or natural breaks in the road.
	Thoroughfare *string `json:"thoroughfare,omitempty"`
	// Traditional counties are provided by the Association of British Counties. It’s historical data, and can date from the 1800s. Data source: Royal Mail. May be empty.
	TraditionalCounty *string `json:"traditional_county,omitempty"`
	// UDPRN stands for ‘Unique Delivery Point Reference Number’. Royal Mail assigns a unique UDPRN code for each premise on PAF. Simple, unique reference number for each Delivery Point. Unlikely to be reused when an address expires. Up to 8-digit numeric code. A new UDPRN is automatically assigned to each new Delivery Point added to PAF.
	Udprn *int `json:"udprn,omitempty"`
	// A small minority of individual premises (as identified by a UDPRN) may have multiple occupants behind the same letterbox. These are known as Multiple Residence occupants and can be queried via the Multiple Residence dataset. Simple, unique reference number for each Multiple Residence occupant. 8-character numeric code. Note: this will be an empty string when not used for legacy reasons
	Umprn *string `json:"umprn,omitempty"`
	// The current administrative/electoral area to which the postcode has been assigned. May be empty for a small number of addresses. Data source: ONS
	Ward *string `json:"ward,omitempty"`
