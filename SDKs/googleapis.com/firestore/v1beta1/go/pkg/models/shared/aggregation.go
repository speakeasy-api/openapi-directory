// Aggregation - Defines a aggregation that produces a single result.
type Aggregation struct {
	// Optional. Optional name of the field to store the result of the aggregation into. If not provided, Firestore will pick a default name following the format `field_`. For example: ``` AGGREGATE COUNT_UP_TO(1) AS count_up_to_1, COUNT_UP_TO(2), COUNT_UP_TO(3) AS count_up_to_3, COUNT_UP_TO(4) OVER ( ... ); ``` becomes: ``` AGGREGATE COUNT_UP_TO(1) AS count_up_to_1, COUNT_UP_TO(2) AS field_1, COUNT_UP_TO(3) AS count_up_to_3, COUNT_UP_TO(4) AS field_2 OVER ( ... ); ``` Requires: * Must be unique across all aggregation aliases. * Conform to document field name limitations.
	Alias *string `json:"alias,omitempty"`
	// Count of documents that match the query. The `COUNT(*)` aggregation function operates on the entire document so it does not require a field reference.
	Count *Count `json:"count,omitempty"`
}
