## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `close_tunnel` - <p>Closes a tunnel identified by the unique tunnel id. When a <code>CloseTunnel</code> request is received, we close the WebSocket connections between the client and proxy server so no data can be transmitted.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">CloseTunnel</a> action.</p>
* `describe_tunnel` - <p>Gets information about a tunnel identified by the unique tunnel id.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">DescribeTunnel</a> action.</p>
* `list_tags_for_resource` - Lists the tags for the specified resource.
* `list_tunnels` - <p>List all tunnels for an Amazon Web Services account. Tunnels are listed by creation time in descending order, newer tunnels will be listed before older tunnels.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">ListTunnels</a> action.</p>
* `open_tunnel` - <p>Creates a new tunnel, and returns two client access tokens for clients to use to connect to the IoT Secure Tunneling proxy server.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">OpenTunnel</a> action.</p>
* `rotate_tunnel_access_token` - <p>Revokes the current client access token (CAT) and returns new CAT for clients to use when reconnecting to secure tunneling to access the same tunnel.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">RotateTunnelAccessToken</a> action.</p> <note> <p>Rotating the CAT doesn't extend the tunnel duration. For example, say the tunnel duration is 12 hours and the tunnel has already been open for 4 hours. When you rotate the access tokens, the new tokens that are generated can only be used for the remaining 8 hours.</p> </note>
* `tag_resource` - A resource tag.
* `untag_resource` - Removes a tag from a resource.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
