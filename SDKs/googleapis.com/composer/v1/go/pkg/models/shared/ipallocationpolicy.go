// IPAllocationPolicy - Configuration for controlling how IPs are allocated in the GKE cluster running the Apache Airflow software.
type IPAllocationPolicy struct {
	// Optional. The IP address range used to allocate IP addresses to pods in the GKE cluster. For Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*, this field is applicable only when `use_ip_aliases` is true. Set to blank to have GKE choose a range with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have GKE choose a range with a specific netmask. Set to a [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) to pick a specific range to use.
	ClusterIpv4CidrBlock *string `json:"clusterIpv4CidrBlock,omitempty"`
	// Optional. The name of the GKE cluster's secondary range used to allocate IP addresses to pods. For Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*, this field is applicable only when `use_ip_aliases` is true.
	ClusterSecondaryRangeName *string `json:"clusterSecondaryRangeName,omitempty"`
	// Optional. The IP address range of the services IP addresses in this GKE cluster. For Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*, this field is applicable only when `use_ip_aliases` is true. Set to blank to have GKE choose a range with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have GKE choose a range with a specific netmask.

	ServicesIpv4CidrBlock *string `json:"servicesIpv4CidrBlock,omitempty"`
	// Optional. The name of the services' secondary range used to allocate IP addresses to the GKE cluster. For Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*, this field is applicable only when `use_ip_aliases` is true.
	ServicesSecondaryRangeName *string `json:"servicesSecondaryRangeName,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Whether or not to enable Alias IPs in the GKE cluster. If `true`, a VPC-native cluster is created. This field is only supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*. Environments in newer versions always use VPC-native GKE clusters.
	UseIPAliases *bool `json:"useIpAliases,omitempty"`
