   * The presence of this field indicates that there exist more results following your last page of results in pagination order.

However, if the contents of the collection change between the first and last paginated list request, the set of all elements returned are an inconsistent view of the collection. You cannot retrieve a consistent snapshot of a collection larger than the maximum page size.
