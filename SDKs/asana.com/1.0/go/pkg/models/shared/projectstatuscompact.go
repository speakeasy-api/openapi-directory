// ProjectStatusCompact - *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the `status_update` resource.*
// A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project, and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, and "red" for projects that are behind.
type ProjectStatusCompact struct {
	// Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string.
	Gid *string `json:"gid,omitempty"`
	// The base type of this resource.
	ResourceType *string `json:"resource_type,omitempty"`
	// The title of the project status update.
	Title *string `json:"title,omitempty"`
