A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request to a deployment.
