/**
 * Request message for Predict method. Full resource name of the format: `{name=projects/* /locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store/placements/*}` The id of the recommendation engine placement. This id is used to identify the set of models that will be used to make the prediction. We currently support three placements with the following IDs by default: // * `shopping_cart`: Predicts items frequently bought together with one or more catalog items in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after `add-to-cart` event, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart page. * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you. * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its relevance to a specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail pages. For example - More items like this. * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 items recently viewed by the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones first. Returns nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet. For example - Recently viewed. The full list of available placements can be seen at https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/catalogs/default_catalog/placements

  /**
   * Optional. Filter for restricting prediction results. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to items that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values by a space. `-"tagA"` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT "tagA"`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1 KiB. * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to items that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-"promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks all prediction results, nothing will be returned. If you want generic (unfiltered) popular items to be returned instead, set `strictFiltering` to false in `PredictRequest.params`.

If set to true, the prediction 'score' corresponding to each returned item will be set in the `metadata` field in the prediction response. The given 'score' indicates the probability of an item being clicked/purchased given the user's context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular items instead of empty if your filter blocks all prediction results. * `priceRerankLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {'no-price-reranking', 'low-price-reranking', 'medium-price-reranking', 'high-price-reranking'}. This gives request level control and adjust prediction results based on product price. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {'no-diversity', 'low-diversity', 'medium-diversity', 'high-diversity', 'auto-diversity'}. This gives request level control and adjust prediction results based on product category.
