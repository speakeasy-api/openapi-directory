	// Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, `Address`, `Categories`). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer "Google" over "Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, "Chase ATM in Duane Reade").
