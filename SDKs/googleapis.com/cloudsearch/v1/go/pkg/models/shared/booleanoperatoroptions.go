// BooleanOperatorOptions - Used to provide a search operator for boolean properties. This is optional. Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields relevant to the type of item being searched.
type BooleanOperatorOptions struct {
	// Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the boolean property. For example, if operatorName is *closed* and the property's name is *isClosed*, then queries like *closed:<value>* show results only where the value of the property named *isClosed* matches *<value>*. By contrast, a search that uses the same *<value>* without an operator returns all items where *<value>* matches the value of any String properties or text within the content field for the item. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters.
	OperatorName *string `json:"operatorName,omitempty"`
