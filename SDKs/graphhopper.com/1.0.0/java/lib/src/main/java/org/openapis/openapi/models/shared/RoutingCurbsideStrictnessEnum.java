/**
 * RoutingCurbsideStrictnessEnum - In some cases curbside constraints cannot be fulfilled. For example in one-way streets you cannot arrive at a building that is on the left side of the street such that the building is to the right of you (unless you drove the one-way street the wrong/illegal way). You can set the `curbside_strictness` to `soft` to ignore the curbside constraint in such cases or set it to `strict` to get an error response instead. You can also set it to `ignore` to ignore all curbside constraints (this is useful to compare the results with and without constraints without modifying every single address).
