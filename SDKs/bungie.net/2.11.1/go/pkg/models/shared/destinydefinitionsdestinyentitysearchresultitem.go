// DestinyDefinitionsDestinyEntitySearchResultItemDisplayProperties - Many Destiny*Definition contracts - the "first order" entities of Destiny that have their own tables in the Manifest Database - also have displayable information. This is the base class for that display information.

	Description *string
	HasIcon     *bool
	// If this item has a high-res icon (at least for now, many things won't), then the path to that icon will be here.
	HighResIcon *string
	// Note that "icon" is sometimes misleading, and should be interpreted in the context of the entity. For instance, in Destiny 1 the DestinyRecordBookDefinition's icon was a big picture of a book.
	// But usually, it will be a small square image that you can use as... well, an icon.
	// They are currently represented as 96px x 96px images.

type DestinyDefinitionsDestinyEntitySearchResultItem struct {
	// Basic display properties on the entity, so you don't have to look up the definition to show basic results for the item.
	DisplayProperties *DestinyDefinitionsDestinyEntitySearchResultItemDisplayProperties
	// The type of entity, returned as a string matching the DestinyDefinition's contract class name. You'll have to have your own mapping from class names to actually looking up those definitions in the manifest databases.
	EntityType *string
	// The hash identifier of the entity. You will use this to look up the DestinyDefinition relevant for the entity found.
	Hash *int64
	// The ranking value for sorting that we calculated using our relevance formula. This will hopefully get better with time and iteration.
