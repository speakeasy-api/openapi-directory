   * Setting this value to true hints to the framework that the source doesn't need splitting, and using SourceSplitRequest on it would yield SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT. E.g. a file splitter may set this to true when splitting a single file into a set of byte ranges of appropriate size, and set this to false when splitting a filepattern into individual files. However, for efficiency, a file splitter may decide to produce file subranges directly from the filepattern to avoid a splitting round-trip. See SourceSplitRequest for an overview of the splitting process. This field is meaningful only in the Source objects populated by the user (e.g. when filling in a DerivedSource). Source objects supplied by the framework to the user don't have this field populated.
