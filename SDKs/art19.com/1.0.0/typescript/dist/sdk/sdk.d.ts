/**
 * The ART19 Content API conforms to the [JSON:API specification](http://jsonapi.org).
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * API requests **MUST** use the HTTP Accept header:
 *
 * `Accept: application/vnd.api+json`
 *
 * API requests **MUST** be authenticated using the HTTP Authorization header:
 *
 * `Authorization: Token token="your-token", credential="your-credential"`
 *
 * ## General Notes
 *
 * Some query parameters use unencoded [ and ] characters simply for readability. Defaults, examples, and
 * possible values are additionally rendered in double quotes for readability. In practice, query parameters should
 * not have quotes around the values (e.g., `foo=bar` is valid, not `foo="bar"`), and both query parameter keys
 * and values must be percent-encoded, per the requirements in [RFC 3986 ยง 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).
 *
 * ## Rate Limiting
 *
 * In order to provide a fair distribution of available resources, all API calls are subject to rate limits.
 * If you exceed the number of API calls per minute granted to your credential, a `429 Too Many Requests`
 * error response will be returned.
 *
 * In that case, a `Retry-After` header MAY be included in the response, describing the number of seconds
 * after which a request can be retried.
 *
 * If you run into a high number of 429 errors, please reach out to ART19 Support to adjust your rate limit.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * In the following example the request can be retried after waiting for 21 seconds:
 *
 *     HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
 *     Content-Type: text/html
 *     Retry-After: 21
 *
 * ## Pagination
 *
 * Requests to collection endpoints **SHOULD** provide pagination parameters.
 * Some endpoints **REQUIRE** pagination parameters to be provided.
 * Whenever pagination is provided, it **MUST** be valid.
 * Failing to provide pagination when it is required or providing wrong or incomplete pagination
 * always results in a `400 Bad Request` error response.
 *
 * The page numbering starts with `1` and the maximum page size (if not otherwise documented
 * on an endpoint) is `100`. Pagination **MUST NOT** be specified if requesting a list of IDs (using an `ids[]` parameter).
 *
 * Providing invalid values for page number or page size, as well as providing only a page number or only a page size,
 * is considered an error. Pagination is provided like this:
 *
 * `page[number]=1&page[size]=25`
 *
 * Responses conform to the [JSON:API specification's pagination section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)
 * by including pagination links. Your requested page size will be carried into the pagination links.
 *
 * ## Sorting
 *
 * Requests to collection endpoints usually accept a `sort` parameter. Please refer to the
 * [JSON:API Specification's sorting section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) for further details.
 *
 * ## Relationship Linking
 *
 * Currently, resources return all of their relationships, in no particular order, pursuant to how relationships
 * should be returned [according to the JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Consumers of this API
 * **MUST NOT** make assumptions about the order of these collections. Even though this data is not currently paginated, consumers **MUST** support
 * paginating relationships per the JSON:API specification if this data is important for their application.
