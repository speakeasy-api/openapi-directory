// DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestone - Information about milestones, presented in a character state-agnostic manner. Combine this data with DestinyMilestoneDefinition to get a full picture of the milestone, which is basically a checklist of things to do in the game. Think of this as GetPublicAdvisors 3.0, for those who used the Destiny 1 API.

	// A milestone not need have even a single quest, but if there are active quests they will be returned here.

	// Sometimes milestones - or activities active in milestones - will have relevant vendors. These are the vendors that are currently relevant.
