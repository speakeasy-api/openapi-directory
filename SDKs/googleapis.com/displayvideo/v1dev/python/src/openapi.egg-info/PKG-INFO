## Available Resources and Operations


### media

* `displayvideo_media_download` - Downloads media. Download is supported on the URI `/download/{resource_name=**}?alt=media.` **Note**: Download requests will not be successful without including `alt=media` query string.
* `displayvideo_media_upload` - Uploads media. Upload is supported on the URI `/upload/media/{resource_name=**}?upload_type=media.` **Note**: Upload requests will not be successful without including `upload_type=media` query string.

### sdfdownloadtasks

* `displayvideo_sdfdownloadtasks_operations_get` - Gets the latest state of an asynchronous SDF download task operation. Clients should poll this method at intervals of 30 seconds.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
