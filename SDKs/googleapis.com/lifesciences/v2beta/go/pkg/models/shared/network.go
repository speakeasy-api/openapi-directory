	// The network name to attach the VM's network interface to. The value will be prefixed with `global/networks/` unless it contains a `/`, in which case it is assumed to be a fully specified network resource URL. If unspecified, the global default network is used.

The value is prefixed with `regions/*/subnetworks/` unless it contains a `/`, in which case it is assumed to be a fully specified subnetwork resource URL. If the `*` character appears in the value, it is replaced with the region that the virtual machine has been allocated in.
