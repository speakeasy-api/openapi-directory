// GoogleMapsPlayablelocationsV3SamplePlayableLocationsResponse -  Response for the SamplePlayableLocations method.
type GoogleMapsPlayablelocationsV3SamplePlayableLocationsResponse struct {
	// Each PlayableLocation object corresponds to a game_object_type specified in the request.
	LocationsPerGameObjectType map[string]GoogleMapsPlayablelocationsV3SamplePlayableLocationList `json:"locationsPerGameObjectType,omitempty"`
	// Required. Specifies the "time-to-live" for the set of playable locations. You can use this value to determine how long to cache the set of playable locations. After this length of time, your back-end game server should issue a new SamplePlayableLocations request to get a fresh set of playable locations (because for example, they might have been removed, a park might have closed for the day, a business might have closed permanently).
