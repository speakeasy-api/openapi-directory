 * ApiSpecInput - An ApiSpec describes a version of an API in a structured way. ApiSpecs provide formal descriptions that consumers can use to use a version. ApiSpec resources are intended to be fully-resolved descriptions of an ApiVersion. When specs consist of multiple files, these should be bundled together (e.g. in a zip archive) and stored as a unit. Multiple specs can exist to provide representations in different API description formats. Synchronization of these representations would be provided by tooling and background services.
