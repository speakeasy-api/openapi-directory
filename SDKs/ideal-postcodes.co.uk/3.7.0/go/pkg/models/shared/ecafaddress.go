	// The Eircode is always the last line of a Postal Address generated within the state, e.g. if an address has four lines then the Eircode will be on its own on Address Line 5. For inbound international mail the country name IRELAND should be appended as the last line of the Postal Address.

	// In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or town. Industrial estates with named thoroughfares are also held as localities. In rural areas the primary locality is generally a townland name.
	PrimaryLocality string `json:"primary_locality"`
	// The name of the thoroughfare on which premises are located. It may appear on a line by itself or be appended to either a sub building or building number.

	PrimaryThoroughfare string `json:"primary_thoroughfare"`
	// Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.

	//

	//
	// The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eola√≠ an Phoist4, describes post towns in the following manner:
	//
	// "A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience."
