// TimeSeriesRatio - A TimeSeriesRatio specifies two TimeSeries to use for computing the good_service / total_service ratio. The specified TimeSeries must have ValueType = DOUBLE or ValueType = INT64 and must have MetricKind = DELTA or MetricKind = CUMULATIVE. The TimeSeriesRatio must specify exactly two of good, bad, and total, and the relationship good_service + bad_service = total_service will be assumed.
