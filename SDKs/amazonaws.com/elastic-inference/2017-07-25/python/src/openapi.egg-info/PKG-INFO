## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `describe_accelerator_offerings` -  Describes the locations in which a given accelerator type or set of types is present in a given region. 
* `describe_accelerator_types` -  Describes the accelerator types available in a given region, as well as their characteristics, such as memory and throughput. 
* `describe_accelerators` -  Describes information over a provided set of accelerators belonging to an account. 
* `list_tags_for_resource` -  Returns all tags of an Elastic Inference Accelerator. 
* `tag_resource` -  Adds the specified tags to an Elastic Inference Accelerator. 
* `untag_resource` -  Removes the specified tags from an Elastic Inference Accelerator. 
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
