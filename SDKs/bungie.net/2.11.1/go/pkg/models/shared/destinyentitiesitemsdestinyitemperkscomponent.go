// DestinyEntitiesItemsDestinyItemPerksComponent - Instanced items can have perks: benefits that the item bestows.
// These are related to DestinySandboxPerkDefinition, and sometimes - but not always - have human readable info. When they do, they are the icons and text that you see in an item's tooltip.
// Talent Grids, Sockets, and the item itself can apply Perks, which are then summarized here for your convenience.

	// The list of perks to display in an item tooltip - and whether or not they have been activated.
