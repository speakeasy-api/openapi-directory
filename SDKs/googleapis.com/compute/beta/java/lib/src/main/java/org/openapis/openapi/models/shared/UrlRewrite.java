For example, a path_template_match of /static/{format=**} could be rewritten as /static/content/{format} to prefix /content to the URL. Variables can also be re-ordered in a rewrite, so that /{country}/{format}/{suffix=**} can be rewritten as /content/{format}/{country}/{suffix}. At least one non-empty routeRules[].matchRules[].path_template_match is required. Only one of path_prefix_rewrite or path_template_rewrite may be specified.
