/** If 'meta' is provided, returns the (json) meta data for the contents of the file.  If 'rendered' is provided, returns the contents of a non-binary file in HTML-formatted rendered markup. Since Git does not generally track what text encoding scheme is used, this endpoint attempts to detect the most appropriate character encoding. While usually correct, determining the character encoding can be ambiguous which in exceptional cases can lead to misinterpretation of the characters. As such, the raw element in the response object should not be treated as equivalent to the file's actual contents. */
