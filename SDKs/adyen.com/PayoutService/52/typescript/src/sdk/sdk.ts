/**
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * For more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts).
 * ## Authentication
 * To use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).
 *
 * Both of these API credentials must be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).The following example shows how to authenticate your request when submitting a payout:
 *
 * ```
 * curl
 * -U "storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD" \
 * -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * ## Versioning
 * Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```
 * https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v52/payout
 * ```
 *
 * ## Going live
 *
 * To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.
 *
 * The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:
 * ```
 *
 * https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v52/payout
 * ```
 *
 * Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.
