 * If you set this field, Zuora creates a stored credential profile within the payment method.
 * 
 * 
 * **Note:** This feature is in the **Early Adopters** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing as generally available.
 * 
 * * `Activate` - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.
 * 
 *   Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.
 *   
 *   If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.
 * 
 * 
 * * `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.
