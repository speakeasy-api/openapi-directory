## Available Resources and Operations


### records

* `chromeuxreport_records_query_history_record` - Queries the Chrome User Experience Report for a timeseries `history record` for a given site. Returns a `history record` that contains one or more `metric timeseries` corresponding to performance data about the requested site.
* `chromeuxreport_records_query_record` - Queries the Chrome User Experience for a single `record` for a given site. Returns a `record` that contains one or more `metrics` corresponding to performance data about the requested site.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
