## SDK Example Usage
<!-- Start SDK Example Usage -->
```python
import sdk
from sdk.models import operations, shared

s = sdk.SDK()


req = operations.KeyRevokeRequest(
    pk="corrupti",
    secret="provident",
)
    
res = s.delete.key_revoke(req)

if res.key_revoke_200_application_json_object is not None:
    # handle response

## Available Resources and Operations


### delete

* `key_revoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `key_revoke_nosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `sign_delete` - delete a verification job

### get

* `key_retrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `sign_retrieve` - get the status / current content of a verification job

### head

* `head_key_pk_` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `sign_retrieve_head` - HEAD to get the status of a verification job

### key

* `head_key_pk_` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `key_bind` - Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.

v4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; 

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes
and PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `key_register` - Register a new ID `JWT(sub, devtoken)`

v5: `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `key_retrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `key_revoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `key_revoke_nosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `key_update` - update properties of an Authentiq ID.
(not operational in v4; use PUT for now)

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes in
a self-signed JWT

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
