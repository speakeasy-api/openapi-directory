### organizations

* `kmsinventoryOrganizationsProtectedResourcesSearch` - Returns metadata about the resources protected by the given Cloud KMS CryptoKey in the given Cloud organization.

### projects

* `kmsinventoryProjectsCryptoKeysList` - Returns cryptographic keys managed by Cloud KMS in a given Cloud project. Note that this data is sourced from snapshots, meaning it may not completely reflect the actual state of key metadata at call time.
* `kmsinventoryProjectsLocationsKeyRingsCryptoKeysGetProtectedResourcesSummary` - Returns aggregate information about the resources protected by the given Cloud KMS CryptoKey. Only resources within the same Cloud organization as the key will be returned. The project that holds the key must be part of an organization in order for this call to succeed.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
