	// A list of examples with labels, in the following format:
	//
	// `[["The movie is so interesting.", "Positive"], ["It is quite boring.", "Negative"], ...]`
	//
	// All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.

	// You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.

	Examples [][]string `json:"examples,omitempty"`
	// If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we support `completion` and `file` objects for expansion.
	Expand []interface{} `json:"expand,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the uploaded file that contains training examples. See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file of the desired format and purpose.
	//
	// You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.
	//
	File *string `json:"file,omitempty"`
	// The set of categories being classified. If not specified, candidate labels will be automatically collected from the examples you provide. All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.

	// Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
	//
	// Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
	//
	// As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
	//
	LogitBias map[string]interface{} `json:"logit_bias,omitempty"`
	// Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.
	//
	// The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com) and describe your use case.
	//
	// When `logprobs` is set, `completion` will be automatically added into `expand` to get the logprobs.
	//
	Logprobs *int64 `json:"logprobs,omitempty"`
	// The maximum number of examples to be ranked by [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using `file`. Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with increased latency and cost.
	MaxExamples *int64 `json:"max_examples,omitempty"`
	// ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them.
	Model string `json:"model"`
	// Query to be classified.
	Query string `json:"query"`
	// A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to `true`, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a "metadata" field.
	//
	// This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.
	//
	ReturnMetadata *bool `json:"return_metadata,omitempty"`
	// If set to `true`, the returned JSON will include a "prompt" field containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.
	ReturnPrompt *bool `json:"return_prompt,omitempty"`
	// ID of the model to use for [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`.
	SearchModel *string `json:"search_model,omitempty"`
	// What sampling `temperature` to use. Higher values mean the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.
	Temperature *float64 `json:"temperature,omitempty"`
	// A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).
