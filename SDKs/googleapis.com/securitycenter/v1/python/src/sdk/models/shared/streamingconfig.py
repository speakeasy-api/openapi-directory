    r"""Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the corresponding resource. The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes."""
