 * ProductSetProductSetBehaviorEnum - The interpretation of this product set. "unknown" should never be sent and is ignored if received. "whitelist" means that the user is entitled to access the product set. "includeAll" means that all products are accessible, including products that are approved, products with revoked approval, and products that have never been approved. "allApproved" means that the user is entitled to access all products that are approved for the enterprise. If the value is "allApproved" or "includeAll", the productId field is ignored. If no value is provided, it is interpreted as "whitelist" for backwards compatibility. Further "allApproved" or "includeAll" does not enable automatic visibility of "alpha" or "beta" tracks for Android app. Use ProductVisibility to enable "alpha" or "beta" tracks per user.
