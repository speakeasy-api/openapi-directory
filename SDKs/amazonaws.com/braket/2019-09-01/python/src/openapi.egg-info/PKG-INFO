## SDK Example Usage
<!-- Start SDK Example Usage -->
```python
import sdk
from sdk.models import operations, shared

s = sdk.SDK(
    security=shared.Security(
        hmac="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    ),
)


req = operations.CancelJobRequest(
    x_amz_algorithm="corrupti",
    x_amz_content_sha256="provident",

## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `cancel_job` - Cancels an Amazon Braket job.
* `cancel_quantum_task` - Cancels the specified task.
* `create_job` - Creates an Amazon Braket job.
* `create_quantum_task` - Creates a quantum task.
* `get_device` - <p>Retrieves the devices available in Amazon Braket.</p> <note> <p>For backwards compatibility with older versions of BraketSchemas, OpenQASM information is omitted from GetDevice API calls. To get this information the user-agent needs to present a recent version of the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or later). The Braket SDK automatically reports this for you. If you do not see OpenQASM results in the GetDevice response when using a Braket SDK, you may need to set AWS_EXECUTION_ENV environment variable to configure user-agent. See the code examples provided below for how to do this for the AWS CLI, Boto3, and the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.</p> </note>
* `get_job` - Retrieves the specified Amazon Braket job.
* `get_quantum_task` - Retrieves the specified quantum task.
* `list_tags_for_resource` - Shows the tags associated with this resource.
* `search_devices` - Searches for devices using the specified filters.
* `search_jobs` - Searches for Amazon Braket jobs that match the specified filter values.
* `search_quantum_tasks` - Searches for tasks that match the specified filter values.
* `tag_resource` - Add a tag to the specified resource.
* `untag_resource` - Remove tags from a resource.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
