 * This API resource represents the OS policies compliance data for a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance at a given point in time.

You can use this API resource to determine both the compliance state of your VM as well as the compliance state of an individual OS policy. For more information, see [View compliance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-configuration-management/view-compliance).
