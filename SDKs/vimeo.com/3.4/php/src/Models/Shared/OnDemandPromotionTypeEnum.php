 * Option descriptions:
 *  * `batch` - Provides many unique promo codes that can only be used once each.
 *  * `batch_prefix` - Similar to `batch`, except that all codes have a similar prefix string. This mode is deprecated, yet it may still appear for some users.
 *  * `single` - Provides a single promo code with many uses.
