// Dimension - Dimensions are attributes of your data. For example, the dimension city indicates the city from which an event originates. Dimension values in report responses are strings; for example, the city could be "Paris" or "New York". Requests are allowed up to 9 dimensions.
type Dimension struct {
	// Used to express a dimension which is the result of a formula of multiple dimensions. Example usages: 1) lower_case(dimension) 2) concatenate(dimension1, symbol, dimension2).
	DimensionExpression *DimensionExpression `json:"dimensionExpression,omitempty"`
	// The name of the dimension. See the [API Dimensions](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema#dimensions) for the list of dimension names. If `dimensionExpression` is specified, `name` can be any string that you would like within the allowed character set. For example if a `dimensionExpression` concatenates `country` and `city`, you could call that dimension `countryAndCity`. Dimension names that you choose must match the regular expression `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]$`. Dimensions are referenced by `name` in `dimensionFilter`, `orderBys`, `dimensionExpression`, and `pivots`.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
