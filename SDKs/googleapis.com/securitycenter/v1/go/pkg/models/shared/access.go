// Access - Represents an access event.
type Access struct {
	// Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
	CallerIP *string `json:"callerIp,omitempty"`
	// Represents a geographical location for a given access.
	CallerIPGeo *Geolocation `json:"callerIpGeo,omitempty"`
	// The method that the service account called, e.g. "SetIamPolicy".
	MethodName *string `json:"methodName,omitempty"`
	// Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email address of the authenticated user or a service account acting on behalf of a third party principal making the request. For third party identity callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes redacted. For more information, see [Caller identities in audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
	PrincipalEmail *string `json:"principalEmail,omitempty"`
	// A string that represents the principal_subject that is associated with the identity. Unlike `principal_email`, `principal_subject` supports principals that aren't associated with email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities, the format is `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM, and GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`.
	PrincipalSubject *string `json:"principalSubject,omitempty"`
	// The identity delegation history of an authenticated service account that made the request. The `serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]` object contains information about the real authorities that try to access Google Cloud resources by delegating on a service account. When multiple authorities are present, they are guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the identity delegation events.
	ServiceAccountDelegationInfo []ServiceAccountDelegationInfo `json:"serviceAccountDelegationInfo,omitempty"`
	// The name of the service account key that was used to create or exchange credentials when authenticating the service account that made the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource name. For example: "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}".
	ServiceAccountKeyName *string `json:"serviceAccountKeyName,omitempty"`
	// This is the API service that the service account made a call to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
	ServiceName *string `json:"serviceName,omitempty"`
	// Type of user agent associated with the finding. For example, an operating system shell or an embedded or standalone application.
	UserAgentFamily *string `json:"userAgentFamily,omitempty"`
	// A string that represents a username. The username provided depends on the type of the finding and is likely not an IAM principal. For example, this can be a system username if the finding is related to a virtual machine, or it can be an application login username.
	UserName *string `json:"userName,omitempty"`
