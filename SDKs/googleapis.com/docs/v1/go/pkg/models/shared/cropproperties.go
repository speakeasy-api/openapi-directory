// CropProperties - The crop properties of an image. The crop rectangle is represented using fractional offsets from the original content's 4 edges. - If the offset is in the interval (0, 1), the corresponding edge of crop rectangle is positioned inside of the image's original bounding rectangle. - If the offset is negative or greater than 1, the corresponding edge of crop rectangle is positioned outside of the image's original bounding rectangle. - If all offsets and rotation angle are 0, the image is not cropped.
type CropProperties struct {
	// The clockwise rotation angle of the crop rectangle around its center, in radians. Rotation is applied after the offsets.
	Angle *float32 `json:"angle,omitempty"`
	// The offset specifies how far inwards the bottom edge of the crop rectangle is from the bottom edge of the original content as a fraction of the original content's height.
	OffsetBottom *float32 `json:"offsetBottom,omitempty"`
	// The offset specifies how far inwards the left edge of the crop rectangle is from the left edge of the original content as a fraction of the original content's width.
	OffsetLeft *float32 `json:"offsetLeft,omitempty"`
	// The offset specifies how far inwards the right edge of the crop rectangle is from the right edge of the original content as a fraction of the original content's width.
	OffsetRight *float32 `json:"offsetRight,omitempty"`
	// The offset specifies how far inwards the top edge of the crop rectangle is from the top edge of the original content as a fraction of the original content's height.
