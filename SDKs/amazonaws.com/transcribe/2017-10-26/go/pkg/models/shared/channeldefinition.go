// ChannelDefinition - Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set <code>ChannelId</code> to <code>0</code> (to indicate the first channel) and <code>ParticipantRole</code> to <code>AGENT</code> (to indicate that it's the agent speaking).
type ChannelDefinition struct {
	ChannelID       *int64               `json:"ChannelId,omitempty"`
	ParticipantRole *ParticipantRoleEnum `json:"ParticipantRole,omitempty"`
}
