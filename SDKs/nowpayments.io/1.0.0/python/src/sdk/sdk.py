    # Sandbox
    
    Before production usage, you can test our API using the Sandbox. Details can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7907941/T1LSCRHC)
    
    # Authentication
    
    To use the NOWPayments API you should do the following:
    
    *   Sign up at [nowpayments.io](https://nowpayments.io)
    *   Specify your outcome wallet
    *   Generate an API key

    # API Documentation
    
    ## Instant Payments Notifications
    
    IPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used to notify you when transaction status is changed.  
    To use them, you should complete the following steps:
    
    1.  Generate and save the IPN Secret key in Store Settings tab at the Dashboard.
    2.  Insert your URL address where you want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url. You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.
    3.  You will receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request.  
        The POST request will contain the *x-nowpayments-sig* parameter in the header.  
        The body of the request is similiar to a [get payment status](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7907941/S1a32n38?version=latest#0b77a8e3-2344-4760-a0bd-247da067db6d) response body.  
        Example:  
        {\"payment_id\":5077125051,\"payment_status\":\"waiting\",\"pay_address\":\"0xd1cDE08A07cD25adEbEd35c3867a59228C09B606\",\"price_amount\":170,\"price_currency\":\"usd\",\"pay_amount\":155.38559757,\"actually_paid\":0,\"pay_currency\":\"mana\",\"order_id\":\"2\",\"order_description\":\"Apple Macbook Pro 2019 x 1\",\"purchase_id\":\"6084744717\",\"created_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:22:54.942Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-04-12T14:23:06.244Z\",\"outcome_amount\":1131.7812095,\"outcome_currency\":\"trx\"}
    4.  Sort all the parameters from the POST request in alphabetical order.
    5.  Convert them to string using  
        [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function.
    6.  Sign a string with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key
    7.  Compare the signed string from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header of the callback request.  
        If these strings are similar it is a success.  
        Otherwise, contact us on [support@nowpayments.io](mailto:support@nowpayments.io) to solve the problem.
        
    
    Example of creating a signed string at Node.JS
    
    ```
    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', notificationsKey);
    hmac.update(JSON.stringify(params, Object.keys(params).sort()));
    const signature = hmac.digest('hex');
    
    ```
    
    Example of comparing signed strings in PHP
    
    ```
    function check_ipn_request_is_valid()
        {
            $error_msg = \"Unknown error\";
            $auth_ok = false;
            $request_data = null;
            if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG']) && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'])) {
                $recived_hmac = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'];
                $request_json = file_get_contents('php://input');
                $request_data = json_decode($request_json, true);
                ksort($request_data);
                $sorted_request_json = json_encode($request_data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);
                if ($request_json !== false && !empty($request_json)) {
                    $hmac = hash_hmac(\"sha512\", $sorted_request_json, trim($this->ipn_secret));
                    if ($hmac == $recived_hmac) {
                        $auth_ok = true;
                    } else {
                        $error_msg = 'HMAC signature does not match';
                    }
                } else {
                    $error_msg = 'Error reading POST data';
                }
            } else {
                $error_msg = 'No HMAC signature sent.';
            }
        }
    
    ```
    
    ## Recurrent payment notifications
    
    If an error is detected, the payment is flagged and will receive additional recurrent notifications (number of recurrent notifications can be changed in your Store Settings-> Instant Payment Notifications).
    
    If an error is received again during processing of the payment, recurrent notifications will be initiated again.
    
    Example: \"Timeout\" is set to 1 minute and \"Number of recurrent notifications\" is set to 3.
    
    Once an error is detected, you will receive 3 notifications at 1 minute intervals.
    
    ## Several payments for one order
    
    If you want to create several payments for one Order you should do the following:
    
    *   Create a payment for the full order amount.
    *   Save \"purchase_id\" which will be in \"create_payment\" response
    *   Create next payment or payments with this \"purchase_id\" in \"create_payment\" request.
    *   **Only works for partially_paid payments**
        
    
    It may be useful if you want to give your customers opportunity to pay a full order with several payments, for example, one part in BTC and one part in ETH. Also, if your customer accidentally paid you only part of a full amount, you can automatically ask them to make another payment.
