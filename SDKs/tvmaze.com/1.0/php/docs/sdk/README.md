## Overview

Access to the user API is only possible for users with a [premium](http://www.tvmaze.com/premium) account. A user can only access their own user data.

Authentication uses HTTP Basic. Use the TVmaze username as authentication username, and the TVmaze API key as authentication password. Your API key can be found on your [dashboard](http://www.tvmaze.com/dashboard). To try out these API calls from this page, click the "Authorize" button on top and input your credentials.
