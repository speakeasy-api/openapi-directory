     * The DigitalNZ API no longer requires a key to access public content. However, if you plan on using the API regularly, expect to be a high volume consumer or are planning on creating an application, we encourage you to use an API key so that we can:
     * - provide targeted help and support
     * - increase your query throughput (by negotiation)
     * - notify you directly of changes to the API
     * - gather usage metrics to help improve the service  
     * 
     * API requests that do not pass a valid API key/token are treated as unauthenticated. A maximum rate limit applies across all unauthenticated requests. This rate limit is in place to protect the service from overuse, resulting in unsustainable costs, or potential attack.
     * 
     * **Getting an API key**  
     * [Create a DigitalNZ account](https://digitalnz.org/sign_up), log in and select "[my API key](https://digitalnz.org/api_keys/edit)" from your username drop-down menu (on the right hand side)'. The key is a long string of jumbled letters and numbers (hash) that is unique to you. You are required to keep the key secret. (Refer to the [Developer API Terms of Use](https://digitalnz.org/about/terms-of-use/developer-api-terms-of-use) for more information).
     * 
     * **Using an API key**  
     * When you make a call to the API you'll need to pass the key in a custom HTTP header: \u2018Authentication-Token\u2019.
     * For example, a query using the \u2018curl\u2019 command might look like the following (where \u2018{YOUR_API_KEY}\u2019 is replaced with a valid API key):
     * 
     * `curl -H "Authentication-Token:{YOUR_API_KEY}" http://api.digitalnz.org/v3/records.json?text=kiwi`
     *
