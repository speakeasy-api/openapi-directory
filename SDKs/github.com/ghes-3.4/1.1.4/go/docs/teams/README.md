## ~~TeamsAddMemberLegacy~~

The "Add team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Add or update team membership for a user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint instead. It allows you to invite new organization members to your teams.

Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

To add someone to a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer in the team they're changing. The person being added to the team must be a member of the team's organization.

**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."

Note that you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

API method documentation
<https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/teams#add-team-member-legacy>

> :warning: **DEPRECATED**: this method will be removed in a future release, please migrate away from it as soon as possible.

### Example Usage

```go
package main

import(
	"context"
	"log"
	"openapi"
	"openapi/pkg/models/operations"
)

func main() {
    s := sdk.New()

    ctx := context.Background()
    res, err := s.Teams.TeamsAddMemberLegacy(ctx, operations.TeamsAddMemberLegacyRequest{
        TeamID: 157281,
        Username: "Stan39",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    if res.StatusCode == http.StatusOK {
        // handle response
    }
}
```

## TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrg

Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.

Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."

An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.

If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

func main() {
    s := sdk.New()

    ctx := context.Background()
    res, err := s.Teams.TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrg(ctx, operations.TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrgRequest{
        RequestBody: &operations.TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrgRequestBody{
            Role: operations.TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserInOrgRequestBodyRoleEnumMember.ToPointer(),
        },
        Org: "quia",
        TeamSlug: "laudantium",
        Username: "Candace_Connelly",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    if res.TeamMembership != nil {
        // handle response
    }
}
```

## ~~TeamsAddOrUpdateMembershipForUserLegacy~~

**Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Add or update team membership for a user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.

Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

If the user is already a member of the team's organization, this endpoint will add the user to the team. To add a membership between an organization member and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.

**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."

If the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint will send an invitation to the user via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the user accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team. To add a membership between an unaffiliated user and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner.

If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.

    }

    if res.TeamMembership != nil {
        // handle response
    }
}
```

## TeamsAddOrUpdateProjectPermissionsInOrg

Adds an organization project to a team. To add a project to a team or update the team's permission on a project, the authenticated user must have `admin` permissions for the project. The project and team must be part of the same organization.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/projects/{project_id}`.

## TeamsAddOrUpdateRepoPermissionsInOrg

To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization. Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

For more information about the permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)".

## TeamsCheckPermissionsForRepoInOrg

Checks whether a team has `admin`, `push`, `maintain`, `triage`, or `pull` permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.

You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/overview/media-types/) via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.

If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

## TeamsCreate

To create a team, the authenticated user must be a member or owner of `{org}`. By default, organization members can create teams. Organization owners can limit team creation to organization owners. For more information, see "[Setting team creation permissions](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/setting-team-creation-permissions-in-your-organization)."

When you create a new team, you automatically become a team maintainer without explicitly adding yourself to the optional array of `maintainers`. For more information, see "[About teams](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams)".

## ~~TeamsRemoveMemberLegacy~~

The "Remove team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Remove team membership for a user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/teams#remove-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint instead. It allows you to remove both active and pending memberships.

Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

To remove a team member, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the org that the team is associated with. Removing a team member does not delete the user, it just removes them from the team.

**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."

**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
