     * The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), and periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the pipeline's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling `google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations`. Note that the Data Pipelines service is not available in all regions. It depends on Cloud Scheduler, an App Engine application, so it's only available in [App Engine regions](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region). * `PIPELINE_ID` is the ID of the pipeline. Must be unique for the selected project and location.
