In addition, this disables certain features that as a side-effect allow user enumeration. Enabling this toggle disables the fetchSignInMethodsForEmail functionality and changing the user's email to an unverified email. It is recommended to remove dependence on this functionality and enable this toggle to improve user privacy."""
