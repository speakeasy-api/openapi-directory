// FacetBucket - A bucket in a facet is the basic unit of operation. A bucket can comprise either a single value OR a contiguous range of values, depending on the type of the field bucketed. FacetBucket is currently used only for returning the response object.
type FacetBucket struct {
	// Number of results that match the bucket value. Counts are only returned for searches when count accuracy is ensured. Cloud Search does not guarantee facet counts for any query and facet counts might be present only intermittently, even for identical queries. Do not build dependencies on facet count existence; instead use facet ount percentages which are always returned.
	Count *int `json:"count,omitempty"`
	// A generic way of expressing filters in a query, which supports two approaches: **1. Setting a ValueFilter.** The name must match an operator_name defined in the schema for your data source. **2. Setting a CompositeFilter.** The filters are evaluated using the logical operator. The top-level operators can only be either an AND or a NOT. AND can appear only at the top-most level. OR can appear only under a top-level AND.
	Filter *Filter `json:"filter,omitempty"`
	// Percent of results that match the bucket value. The returned value is between (0-100], and is rounded down to an integer if fractional. If the value is not explicitly returned, it represents a percentage value that rounds to 0. Percentages are returned for all searches, but are an estimate. Because percentages are always returned, you should render percentages instead of counts.
	Percentage *int `json:"percentage,omitempty"`
	// Definition of a single value with generic type.
	Value *Value `json:"value,omitempty"`
