 * Dispute - A customer may file a payment dispute with their bank or other card issuer when they're unsatisfied with their purchase or believe they have been charged incorrectly. For example:  
 * 
 * - They didn't receive an order.  
 * - The product they received was different to the commerce store's description.  
 * - They've been the victim of online fraud.

 * You can use data from the Disputes endpoints to calculate key metrics, such as the number of chargebacks.
