// Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [Custom Fields](/docs/asana-custom-fields) developer documentation for more information about how custom fields relate to various resources in Asana.

// Users in Asana can [lock custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields#gl-lock-fields), which will make them read-only when accessed by other users. Attempting to edit a locked custom field will return HTTP error code `403 Forbidden`.
