The default is 0.5. * For Image Object Detection: `score_threshold` - (float) When Model detects objects on the image, it will only produce bounding boxes which have at least this confidence score. Value in 0 to 1 range, default is 0.5. `max_bounding_box_count` - (int64) No more than this number of bounding boxes will be returned in the response. Default is 100, the requested value may be limited by server. * For Tables: feature_importance - (boolean) Whether feature importance should be populated in the returned TablesAnnotation.
