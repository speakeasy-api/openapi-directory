     *
     * This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
     *   1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now.
     *   2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
     *   3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates.
     *   4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.
