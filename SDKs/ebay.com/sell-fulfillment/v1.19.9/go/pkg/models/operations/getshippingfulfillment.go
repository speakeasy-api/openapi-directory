	FulfillmentID string `pathParam:"style=simple,explode=false,name=fulfillmentId"`
	// The unique identifier of the order. Order ID values are shown in My eBay/Seller Hub, and are also returned by the getOrders method in the orders.orderId field. Note: A new order ID format was introduced to all eBay APIs (legacy and REST) in June 2019. In REST APIs that return Order IDs, including the Fulfillment API, all order IDs are returned in the new format, but the getShippingFulfillment method will accept both the legacy and new format order ID. The new format is a non-parsable string, globally unique across all eBay marketplaces, and consistent for both single line item and multiple line item orders. These order identifiers will be automatically generated after buyer payment, and unlike in the past, instead of just being known and exposed to the seller, these unique order identifiers will also be known and used/referenced by the buyer and eBay customer support.
