/**
 * GetPageItemDetailExpandEnum - Only relevant when loading item detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.
 * 
 * If no value is specified no item dependencies are expanded.
 * 
 * If 'children' is specified then the list of any direct children will be expanded. For example
 * seasons of a show or episodes of a season.
 * 
 * If 'all' is specified then the parent chain will be expanded along with any child list at each level.
 * For example if an episode is specified then its season will be expanded and that season's episode list.
 * The season will have its show expanded and the show will have its season list expanded.
 * 
 * The 'all' options is useful when you deep link into a show/season/episode for the first time as
 * it provides full context for navigating around the show page. Subsequent navigation around
 * children of the show should only need to request expand of children.
 * 
 * If 'ancestors' is specified then only the parent chain is included
 * 
 * If an expand is specified which is not relevant to the item type, it will be ignored.
