In the given project a new dataset will be created with name `export_evaluated_examples__` where will be made BigQuery-dataset-name compatible (e.g. most special characters will become underscores), and timestamp will be in YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ "based on ISO-8601" format. In the dataset an `evaluated_examples` table will be created. It will have all the same columns as the primary_table of the dataset from which the model was created, as they were at the moment of model's evaluation (this includes the target column with its ground truth), followed by a column called "predicted_". That last column will contain the model's prediction result for each respective row, given as ARRAY of AnnotationPayloads, represented as STRUCT-s, containing TablesAnnotation.
