These headers represent a subset of the headers that will be configured for the task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is: * Several predefined headers, prefixed with \\"X-CloudTasks-\\", can be used to define properties of the task. * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from HttpRequest.url. * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks. `Content-Type` won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set `Content-Type` to a media type when the task is created. For example,`Content-Type` can be set to `\\"application/octet-stream\\"` or `\\"application/json\\"`. The default value is set to \\"application/json\\"`. * User-Agent: This will be set to `\\"Google-Cloud-Tasks\\"`. Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be specified using comma-separated values. The size of the headers must be less than 80KB.
