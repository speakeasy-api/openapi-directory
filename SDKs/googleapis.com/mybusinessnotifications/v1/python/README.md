## Available Resources and Operations


### accounts

* `mybusinessnotifications_accounts_get_notification_setting` - Returns the pubsub notification settings for the account.
* `mybusinessnotifications_accounts_update_notification_setting` - Sets the pubsub notification setting for the account informing Google which topic to send pubsub notifications for. Use the notification_types field within notification_setting to manipulate the events an account wants to subscribe to. An account will only have one notification setting resource, and only one pubsub topic can be set. To delete the setting, update with an empty notification_types
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
