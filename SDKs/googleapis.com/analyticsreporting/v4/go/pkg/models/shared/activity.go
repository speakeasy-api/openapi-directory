// Activity - An Activity represents data for an activity of a user. Note that an Activity is different from a hit. A hit might result in multiple Activity's. For example, if a hit includes a transaction and a goal completion, there will be two Activity protos for this hit, one for ECOMMERCE and one for GOAL. Conversely, multiple hits can also construct one Activity. In classic e-commerce, data for one transaction might be sent through multiple hits. These hits will be merged into one ECOMMERCE Activity.
type Activity struct {
	// Timestamp of the activity. If activities for a visit cross midnight and occur in two separate dates, then two sessions (one per date) share the session identifier.

Session ID 113472 is one session, and session ID 243742 is two sessions.
