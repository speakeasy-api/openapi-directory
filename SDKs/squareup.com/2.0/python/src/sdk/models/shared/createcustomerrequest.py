    r"""Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based
    on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information, 
    see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata). 
    This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code, 
    locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and 
    sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the 
    `Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them. 
    For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax 
    based on the postal code, and some software is only available in 
    certain states due to compliance reasons.
    
    For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the 
    `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry. 
    These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have 
    too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse 
    these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want. 
    
    Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank. 
    These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`, 
    `administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`, 
    `first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`. 
    
    When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences 
    (see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences)) 
    are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale 
    and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in 
    communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address, 
    Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on.
