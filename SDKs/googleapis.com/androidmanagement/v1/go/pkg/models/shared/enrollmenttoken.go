After a device enrolls with the token, this data will be exposed in the enrollment_token_data field of the Device resource. The data must be 1024 characters or less; otherwise, the creation request will fail.

If not specified, the default duration is 1 hour. Please note that if requested duration causes the resulting expiration_timestamp to exceed Timestamps.MAX_VALUE (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/util/Timestamps.html#MAX_VALUE), then expiration_timestamp is coerced to Timestamps.MAX_VALUE.

When updating this field, you can specify only the policyId as long as the policyId doesn’t contain any slashes. The rest of the policy name will be inferred.
