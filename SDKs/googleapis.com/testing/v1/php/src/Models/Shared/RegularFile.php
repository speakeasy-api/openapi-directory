The paths /sdcard and /data will be made available and treated as implicit path substitutions. E.g. if /sdcard on a particular device does not map to external storage, the system will replace it with the external storage path prefix for that device and copy the file there. It is strongly advised to use the Environment API in app and test code to access files on the device in a portable way.
