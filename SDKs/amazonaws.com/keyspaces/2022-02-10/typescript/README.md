## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `createKeyspace` - <p>The <code>CreateKeyspace</code> operation adds a new keyspace to your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, keyspace names must be unique within each Region.</p> <p> <code>CreateKeyspace</code> is an asynchronous operation. You can monitor the creation status of the new keyspace by using the <code>GetKeyspace</code> operation.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/working-with-keyspaces.html#keyspaces-create">Creating keyspaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createTable` - <p>The <code>CreateTable</code> operation adds a new table to the specified keyspace. Within a keyspace, table names must be unique.</p> <p> <code>CreateTable</code> is an asynchronous operation. When the request is received, the status of the table is set to <code>CREATING</code>. You can monitor the creation status of the new table by using the <code>GetTable</code> operation, which returns the current <code>status</code> of the table. You can start using a table when the status is <code>ACTIVE</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/working-with-tables.html#tables-create">Creating tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `deleteKeyspace` - The <code>DeleteKeyspace</code> operation deletes a keyspace and all of its tables. 
* `deleteTable` - The <code>DeleteTable</code> operation deletes a table and all of its data. After a <code>DeleteTable</code> request is received, the specified table is in the <code>DELETING</code> state until Amazon Keyspaces completes the deletion. If the table is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can delete it. If a table is either in the <code>CREATING</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> states, then Amazon Keyspaces returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If the specified table does not exist, Amazon Keyspaces returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. If the table is already in the <code>DELETING</code> state, no error is returned.
* `getKeyspace` - Returns the name and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified table.
* `getTable` - <p>Returns information about the table, including the table's name and current status, the keyspace name, configuration settings, and metadata.</p> <p>To read table metadata using <code>GetTable</code>, <code>Select</code> action permissions for the table and system tables are required to complete the operation.</p>
* `listKeyspaces` - Returns a list of keyspaces.
* `listTables` - Returns a list of tables for a specified keyspace.
* `listTagsForResource` - Returns a list of all tags associated with the specified Amazon Keyspaces resource.
* `restoreTable` - <p>Restores the specified table to the specified point in time within the <code>earliest_restorable_timestamp</code> and the current time. For more information about restore points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_window"> Time window for PITR continuous backups</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Any number of users can execute up to 4 concurrent restores (any type of restore) in a given account.</p> <p>When you restore using point in time recovery, Amazon Keyspaces restores your source table's schema and data to the state based on the selected timestamp <code>(day:hour:minute:second)</code> to a new table. The Time to Live (TTL) settings are also restored to the state based on the selected timestamp.</p> <p>In addition to the table's schema, data, and TTL settings, <code>RestoreTable</code> restores the capacity mode, encryption, and point-in-time recovery settings from the source table. Unlike the table's schema data and TTL settings, which are restored based on the selected timestamp, these settings are always restored based on the table's settings as of the current time or when the table was deleted.</p> <p>You can also overwrite these settings during restore:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Read/write capacity mode</p> </li> <li> <p>Provisioned throughput capacity settings</p> </li> <li> <p>Point-in-time (PITR) settings</p> </li> <li> <p>Tags</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_settings">PITR restore settings</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Note that the following settings are not restored, and you must configure them manually for the new table:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatic scaling policies (for tables that use provisioned capacity mode)</p> </li> <li> <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms</p> </li> </ul>
* `tagResource` - <p>Associates a set of tags with a Amazon Keyspaces resource. You can then activate these user-defined tags so that they appear on the Cost Management Console for cost allocation tracking. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/tagging-keyspaces.html">Adding tags and labels to Amazon Keyspaces resources</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For IAM policy examples that show how to control access to Amazon Keyspaces resources based on tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-tags">Amazon Keyspaces resource access based on tags</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `untagResource` - Removes the association of tags from a Amazon Keyspaces resource.
* `updateTable` - Adds new columns to the table or updates one of the table's settings, for example capacity mode, encryption, point-in-time recovery, or ttl settings. Note that you can only update one specific table setting per update operation.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
