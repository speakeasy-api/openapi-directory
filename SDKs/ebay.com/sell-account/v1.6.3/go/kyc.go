// GetKYC - This method is used by sellers onboarded for eBay managed payments, or sellers who are currently going through, or who are eligible for onboarding for eBay managed payments. With this method, a seller can discover if there are any action items in regards to providing more documentation and/or information about themselves, their company, or the bank account they are or will be using for seller payouts. These 'action items' are also know as 'Know Your Customer' (or KYC) checks. This method does not require any parameters other than the OAuth user token associated with the seller's account. If the managed payments seller does not currently have any pending 'KYC' action items, only a 204 No Content HTTP status code is returned, and no response payload. Note: This method is not applicable for sellers who are not eligible for eBay managed payments. For sellers who sell on one or more eBay marketplaces that currently support managed payments, they can check on their managed payments onboarding status by using the getPaymentsProgramOnboarding method.
