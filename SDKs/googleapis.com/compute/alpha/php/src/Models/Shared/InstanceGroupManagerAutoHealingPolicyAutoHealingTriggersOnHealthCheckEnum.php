/** If you have configured an application-based health check for the group, this field controls whether to trigger VM autohealing based on a failed health check. Valid values are: - ON (default): The group recreates running VMs that fail the application-based health check. - OFF: When set to OFF, you can still observe instance health state, but the group does not recreate VMs that fail the application-based health check. This is useful for troubleshooting and setting up your health check configuration.  */
