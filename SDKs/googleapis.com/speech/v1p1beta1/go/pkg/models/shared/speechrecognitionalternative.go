type SpeechRecognitionAlternative struct {
	// The confidence estimate between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. This field is set only for the top alternative of a non-streaming result or, of a streaming result where `is_final=true`. This field is not guaranteed to be accurate and users should not rely on it to be always provided. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating `confidence` was not set.
