/**
 * This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * The Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a verification check or a payout has been completed.
 *
 * For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).
 * ## Authentication
 * Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:
 *
 *  ```
 * curl
 * -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 * -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * curl
 * -U "ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
 * -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 * ...
 * ```
 * When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).
 *
 * ## Versioning
 * The Notification Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```
 * https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v4/createNotificationConfiguration
 * ```
