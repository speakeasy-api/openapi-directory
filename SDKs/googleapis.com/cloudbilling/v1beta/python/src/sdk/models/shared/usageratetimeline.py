class UsageRateTimeline:
    r"""A timeline of usage rates. Consists of a series of entries, each of which specifies a constant rate of usage during a time interval. Each entry contains an effective time. The usage rate is in effect from that time until the effective time of the subsequent entry, or, for the last entry, for the remaining portion of estimation time frame. Effective times are specified as an offset into the estimation time frame. Usage is considered to be zero until the `effective_time` of the first entry. All subsequent entries must have an effective time greater than the previous entry and less than the estimate time frame. The effective time on all entries must be an integer number of hours."""

    r"""The unit for the usage rate in each timeline entry. If you provide an incorrect unit for an instance, the correct unit is provided in the error message. The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://ucum.org/ucum.html) standard: * **Time units (TIME-UNIT)** * `s` second * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `wk` week * `mo` month * `yr` year * `ms` millisecond * `us` microsecond * `ns` nanosecond * **Basic storage units (BASIC-STORAGE-UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * **Count units (COUNT-UNIT)** * `count` count * **Prefixes (PREFIX)** * `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12) * `P` peta (10^15) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator). For example: `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms`. * `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For example: `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows: ``` Expression = Component { \\".\\" Component } { \\"/\\" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \\"%\\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \\"1\\" ; UNIT = TIME-UNIT | STORAGE-UNIT | DATA-UNIT | COUNT-UNIT Annotation = \\"{\\" NAME \\"}\\" ; ``` Examples: * Request per second: `1/s` or `{requests}/s` * GibiBytes: `GiBy` * GibiBytes * seconds: `GiBy.s`"""
