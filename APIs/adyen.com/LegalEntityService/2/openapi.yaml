    The Legal Entity Management API enables you to manage legal entities that contain information required for verification. 
    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Legal Entity Management API, you must use the basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new). Use the web service user credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws_123456@Scope.BalancePlatform_YourBalancePlatform":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The Legal Entity Management API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://kyc-test.adyen.com/lem/v2/legalEntities
    ```
    ## Going live
    When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://kyc-live.adyen.com/lem/v2`.

        Creates a transfer instrument. 

        A transfer instrument is a bank account that a legal entity owns. Adyen performs verification checks on the transfer instrument as required by payment industry regulations. We inform you of the verification results through webhooks or API responses.

        When the transfer instrument passes the verification checks, you can start sending funds from the balance platform to the transfer instrument (such as payouts).
