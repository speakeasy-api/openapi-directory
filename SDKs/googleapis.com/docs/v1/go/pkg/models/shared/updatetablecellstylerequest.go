// UpdateTableCellStyleRequest - Updates the style of a range of table cells.
type UpdateTableCellStyleRequest struct {
	// The fields that should be updated. At least one field must be specified. The root `tableCellStyle` is implied and should not be specified. A single `"*"` can be used as short-hand for listing every field. For example to update the table cell background color, set `fields` to `"backgroundColor"`. To reset a property to its default value, include its field name in the field mask but leave the field itself unset.
	Fields *string `json:"fields,omitempty"`
	// The style of a TableCell. Inherited table cell styles are represented as unset fields in this message. A table cell style can inherit from the table's style.
	TableCellStyle *TableCellStyle `json:"tableCellStyle,omitempty"`
	// A table range represents a reference to a subset of a table. It's important to note that the cells specified by a table range do not necessarily form a rectangle. For example, let's say we have a 3 x 3 table where all the cells of the last row are merged together. The table looks like this: [ ] A table range with table cell location = (table_start_location, row = 0, column = 0), row span = 3 and column span = 2 specifies the following cells: x x [ x x x ]
	TableRange *TableRange `json:"tableRange,omitempty"`
	// A particular location in the document.
	TableStartLocation *Location `json:"tableStartLocation,omitempty"`
