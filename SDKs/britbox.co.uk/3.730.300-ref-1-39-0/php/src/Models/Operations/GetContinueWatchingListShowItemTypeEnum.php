 * The item type to be returned for continue watching items belonging to a show.
 * 
 * 
 * Multiple episodes under the same show may be watched or in progress, however only a
 * single item belonging to a particular show will be included in the returned list.
 * 
 * The next episode to continue watching for a particular show will be the most recent
 * incompletely watched episode, or the next episode following the most recently
 * completely watched episode. Based on the specified `show_item_type` type, either the next
 * episode, the season of the next episode, or the show will be included in the list.
 * 
 * If `episode` is specified, then only the next episode to continue watching for a
 * show will be returned.
 * 
 * If `season` is specified, then only the season of the next episode will be returned.
 * 
 * If `show` is specified, then only the show of the next episode will be returned
 * 
 * The recommended value of this parameter should reflect the desitination the
 * user will be sent to when they select this item in the list. So if a user will
 * be sent to the show detail page then this should be `show` and you can use
 * the `include` parameter to get metadata about the episode or season if needed
