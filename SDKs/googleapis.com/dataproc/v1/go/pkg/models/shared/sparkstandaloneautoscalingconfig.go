// SparkStandaloneAutoscalingConfig - Basic autoscaling configurations for Spark Standalone.
type SparkStandaloneAutoscalingConfig struct {
	// Required. Timeout for Spark graceful decommissioning of spark workers. Specifies the duration to wait for spark worker to complete spark decomissioning tasks before forcefully removing workers. Only applicable to downscaling operations.Bounds: 0s, 1d.
	GracefulDecommissionTimeout *string `json:"gracefulDecommissionTimeout,omitempty"`
	// Required. Fraction of required executors to remove from Spark Serverless clusters. A scale-down factor of 1.0 will result in scaling down so that there are no more executors for the Spark Job.(more aggressive scaling). A scale-down factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling donw (less aggressive scaling).Bounds: 0.0, 1.0.
	ScaleDownFactor *float64 `json:"scaleDownFactor,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0 means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. Default: 0.0.
	ScaleDownMinWorkerFraction *float64 `json:"scaleDownMinWorkerFraction,omitempty"`
	// Required. Fraction of required workers to add to Spark Standalone clusters. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there are no more required workers for the Spark Job (more aggressive scaling). A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up (less aggressive scaling).Bounds: 0.0, 1.0.
	ScaleUpFactor *float64 `json:"scaleUpFactor,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. Default: 0.0.
