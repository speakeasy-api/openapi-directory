// Deployment - Successful response
type Deployment struct {
	// An optional user-provided description of the deployment.
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request to a deployment.
	Fingerprint *string `json:"fingerprint,omitempty"`
	ID          *string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Output only. Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
	InsertTime *string `json:"insertTime,omitempty"`
	// Map of One Platform labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.
	Labels []DeploymentLabelEntry `json:"labels,omitempty"`
	// Output only. URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was successfully deployed. If no manifest has been successfully deployed, this field will be absent.
	Manifest *string `json:"manifest,omitempty"`
	// Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
	Operation *Operation `json:"operation,omitempty"`
	// Output only. Server defined URL for the resource.
	SelfLink *string              `json:"selfLink,omitempty"`
	Target   *TargetConfiguration `json:"target,omitempty"`
	Update   *DeploymentUpdate    `json:"update,omitempty"`
	// Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
	UpdateTime *string `json:"updateTime,omitempty"`
