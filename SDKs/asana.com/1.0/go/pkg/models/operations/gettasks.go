This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.

	// Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

	Project *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=project"`
