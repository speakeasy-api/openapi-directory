// BankPriorityEnum - The priority for the bank transfer. This sets the speed at which the transfer is sent and the fees that you have to pay. If you don't provide this in the request, Adyen sets the optimal priority.
//
// Possible values:
//
// * **regular**: For normal, low-value transactions.
//
// * **fast**: Faster way to transfer funds but has higher fees. Recommended for high-priority, low-value transactions.
//
// * **wire**: Fastest way to transfer funds but has the highest fees. Recommended for high-priority, high-value transactions.
//
// * **instant**: Instant way to transfer funds in [SEPA countries](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html).
//
// * **crossBorder**: High value transfer to receipt in a different country.
//
// * **internal**: Bank transfers to a bank account held at Adyen (by bank account number/IBAN).
