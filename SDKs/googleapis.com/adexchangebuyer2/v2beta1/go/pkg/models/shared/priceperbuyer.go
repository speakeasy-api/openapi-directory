// PricePerBuyer - Used to specify pricing rules for buyers/advertisers. Each PricePerBuyer in a product can become 0 or 1 deals. To check if there is a PricePerBuyer for a particular buyer or buyer/advertiser pair, we look for the most specific matching rule - we first look for a rule matching the buyer and advertiser, next a rule with the buyer but an empty advertiser list, and otherwise look for a matching rule where no buyer is set.
type PricePerBuyer struct {
	// The list of advertisers for this price when associated with this buyer. If empty, all advertisers with this buyer pay this price.
	AdvertiserIds []string `json:"advertiserIds,omitempty"`
	// Represents a buyer of inventory. Each buyer is identified by a unique Authorized Buyers account ID.
	Buyer *Buyer `json:"buyer,omitempty"`
	// Represents a price and a pricing type for a product / deal.
	Price *Price `json:"price,omitempty"`
