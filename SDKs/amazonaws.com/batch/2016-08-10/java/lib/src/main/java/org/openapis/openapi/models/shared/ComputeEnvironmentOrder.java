/**
 * ComputeEnvironmentOrder - &lt;p&gt;The order that compute environments are tried in for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the &lt;code&gt;VALID&lt;/code&gt; state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (&lt;code&gt;EC2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SPOT&lt;/code&gt;) or Fargate (&lt;code&gt;FARGATE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FARGATE_SPOT&lt;/code&gt;); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt;
