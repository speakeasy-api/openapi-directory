// GoogleCloudDatacatalogV1UsageStats - Detailed statistics on the entry's usage. Usage statistics have the following limitations: - Only BigQuery tables have them. - They only include BigQuery query jobs. - They might be underestimated because wildcard table references are not yet counted. For more information, see [Querying multiple tables using a wildcard table] (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-wildcard-tables)
