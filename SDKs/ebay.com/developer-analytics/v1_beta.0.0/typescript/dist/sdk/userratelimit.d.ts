     * This method retrieves the call limit and utilization data for an application user.

In addition to quota information, the response also includes the number of remaining calls available before the limit is reached, the time remaining before the quota resets, and the length of the "time window" to which the quota applies.  <br><br>By default, this method returns utilization data for all RESTful APIs resources and the legacy Trading API calls that limit request access by user. Use the <b>api_name</b> and <b>api_context</b> query parameters to filter the response to only the desired APIs.  <br><br>For more on call limits, see <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/support/app-check " target="_blank">Compatible Application Check</a>.
