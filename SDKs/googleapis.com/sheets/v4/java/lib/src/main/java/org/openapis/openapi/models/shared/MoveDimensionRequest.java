Existing data will be shifted down or right (depending on the dimension) to make room for the moved dimensions. The source dimensions are removed from the grid, so the the data may end up in a different index than specified. For example, given `A1..A5` of `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` and wanting to move `"1"` and `"2"` to between `"3"` and `"4"`, the source would be `ROWS [1..3)`,and the destination index would be `"4"` (the zero-based index of row 5). The end result would be `A1..A5` of `0, 3, 1, 2, 4`.
