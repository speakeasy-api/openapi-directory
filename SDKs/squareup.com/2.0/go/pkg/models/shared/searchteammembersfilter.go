// SearchTeamMembersFilter - Represents a filter used in a search for `TeamMember` objects. `AND` logic is applied
// between the individual fields, and `OR` logic is applied within list-based fields.
// For example, setting this filter value:
// ```
// filter = (locations_ids = ["A", "B"], status = ACTIVE)
// ```
// returns only active team members assigned to either location "A" or "B".
type SearchTeamMembersFilter struct {
	// When present, filters by team members assigned to the specified locations.
	// When empty, includes team members assigned to any location.
	LocationIds []string `json:"location_ids,omitempty"`
	// When present, filters by team members who match the given status.
	// When empty, includes team members of all statuses.
	Status *string `json:"status,omitempty"`
