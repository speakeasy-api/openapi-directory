## Available Resources and Operations


### documents

* `language_documents_analyze_entities` - Finds named entities (currently proper names and common nouns) in the text along with entity types, salience, mentions for each entity, and other properties.
* `language_documents_analyze_sentiment` - Analyzes the sentiment of the provided text.
* `language_documents_analyze_syntax` - Analyzes the syntax of the text and provides sentence boundaries and tokenization along with part of speech tags, dependency trees, and other properties.
* `language_documents_annotate_text` - A convenience method that provides all the features that analyzeSentiment, analyzeEntities, and analyzeSyntax provide in one call.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
