// GoogleCloudDiscoveryengineV1alphaTransactionInfo - A transaction represents the entire purchase transaction.
type GoogleCloudDiscoveryengineV1alphaTransactionInfo struct {
	// All the costs associated with the products. These can be manufacturing costs, shipping expenses not borne by the end user, or any other costs, such that: * Profit = value - tax - cost
	Cost *float32 `json:"cost,omitempty"`
	// Required. Currency code. Use three-character ISO-4217 code.
	Currency *string `json:"currency,omitempty"`
	// The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction. This figure should be excluded from TransactionInfo.value For example, if a user paid TransactionInfo.value amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction is the sum of TransactionInfo.value and TransactionInfo.discount_value This means that profit is calculated the same way, regardless of the discount value, and that TransactionInfo.discount_value can be larger than TransactionInfo.value: * Profit = value - tax - cost
	DiscountValue *float32 `json:"discountValue,omitempty"`
	// All the taxes associated with the transaction.
	Tax *float32 `json:"tax,omitempty"`
	// The transaction ID with a length limit of 128 characters.
	TransactionID *string `json:"transactionId,omitempty"`
	// Required. Total non-zero value associated with the transaction. This value may include shipping, tax, or other adjustments to the total value that you want to include.
	Value *float32 `json:"value,omitempty"`
