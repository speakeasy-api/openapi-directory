// Disk - Carries information about a disk that can be attached to a VM. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance for more information about disk type, size, and performance considerations. Specify either `Volume` or `Disk`, but not both.
type Disk struct {
	// A user-supplied name for the disk. Used when mounting the disk into actions. The name must contain only upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens and cannot start with a hyphen.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The size, in GB, of the disk to attach. If the size is not specified, a default is chosen to ensure reasonable I/O performance. If the disk type is specified as `local-ssd`, multiple local drives are automatically combined to provide the requested size. Note, however, that each physical SSD is 375GB in size, and no more than 8 drives can be attached to a single instance.
	SizeGb *int `json:"sizeGb,omitempty"`
	// An optional image to put on the disk before attaching it to the VM.
	SourceImage *string `json:"sourceImage,omitempty"`
	// The Compute Engine disk type. If unspecified, `pd-standard` is used.
	Type *string `json:"type,omitempty"`
