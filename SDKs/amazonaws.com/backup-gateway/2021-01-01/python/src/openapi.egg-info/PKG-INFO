## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `associate_gateway_to_server` - Associates a backup gateway with your server. After you complete the association process, you can back up and restore your VMs through the gateway.
* `create_gateway` - Creates a backup gateway. After you create a gateway, you can associate it with a server using the <code>AssociateGatewayToServer</code> operation.
* `delete_gateway` - Deletes a backup gateway.
* `delete_hypervisor` - Deletes a hypervisor.
* `disassociate_gateway_from_server` - Disassociates a backup gateway from the specified server. After the disassociation process finishes, the gateway can no longer access the virtual machines on the server.
* `get_bandwidth_rate_limit_schedule` - Retrieves the bandwidth rate limit schedule for a specified gateway. By default, gateways do not have bandwidth rate limit schedules, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. Use this to get a gateway's bandwidth rate limit schedule.
* `get_gateway` - By providing the ARN (Amazon Resource Name), this API returns the gateway.
* `get_hypervisor` - This action requests information about the specified hypervisor to which the gateway will connect. A hypervisor is hardware, software, or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines, and allocates resources to them.
* `get_hypervisor_property_mappings` - This action retrieves the property mappings for the specified hypervisor. A hypervisor property mapping displays the relationship of entity properties available from the on-premises hypervisor to the properties available in Amazon Web Services.
* `get_virtual_machine` - By providing the ARN (Amazon Resource Name), this API returns the virtual machine.
* `import_hypervisor_configuration` - Connect to a hypervisor by importing its configuration.
* `list_gateways` - Lists backup gateways owned by an Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region. The returned list is ordered by gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
* `list_hypervisors` - Lists your hypervisors.
* `list_tags_for_resource` - Lists the tags applied to the resource identified by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
* `list_virtual_machines` - Lists your virtual machines.
* `put_bandwidth_rate_limit_schedule` - This action sets the bandwidth rate limit schedule for a specified gateway. By default, gateways do not have a bandwidth rate limit schedule, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. Use this to initiate a gateway's bandwidth rate limit schedule.
* `put_hypervisor_property_mappings` - This action sets the property mappings for the specified hypervisor. A hypervisor property mapping displays the relationship of entity properties available from the on-premises hypervisor to the properties available in Amazon Web Services.
* `put_maintenance_start_time` - Set the maintenance start time for a gateway.
* `start_virtual_machines_metadata_sync` - This action sends a request to sync metadata across the specified virtual machines.
* `tag_resource` - Tag the resource.
* `test_hypervisor_configuration` - Tests your hypervisor configuration to validate that backup gateway can connect with the hypervisor and its resources.
* `untag_resource` - Removes tags from the resource.
* `update_gateway_information` - Updates a gateway's name. Specify which gateway to update using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.
* `update_gateway_software_now` - <p>Updates the gateway virtual machine (VM) software. The request immediately triggers the software update.</p> <note> <p>When you make this request, you get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the update to complete.</p> </note>
* `update_hypervisor` - Updates a hypervisor metadata, including its host, username, and password. Specify which hypervisor to update using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the hypervisor in your request.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
