 * DeveloperMetadataLookupLocationTypeEnum - Limits the selected developer metadata to those entries which are associated with locations of the specified type.

This field cannot be specified as SPREADSHEET when the locationMatchingStrategy is specified as INTERSECTING or when the metadataLocation is specified as a non-spreadsheet location: spreadsheet metadata cannot intersect any other developer metadata location. This field also must be left unspecified when the locationMatchingStrategy is specified as EXACT.
