See ComplianceTypeEnum for more information on the compliance types that can be passed in here.

This is because all of a listing's policy violations {each compliance type) will be returned if a listing_id is provided. Either the listing_id or a compliance_type query parameter must be used, and if the seller only wants to view listing violations of a specific compliance type, both of these parameters can be used. Note: The listing_id query parameter is not yet available for use, so the seller does not have the ability to retrieve listing violations for one or more specific listings. Until the listing_id query parameter becomes available, the compliance_type query parameter is required with each getListingViolations call.
