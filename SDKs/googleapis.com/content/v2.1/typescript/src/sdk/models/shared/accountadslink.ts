   * Status of the link between this Merchant Center account and the Ads account. Upon retrieval, it represents the actual status of the link and can be either `active` if it was approved in Google Ads or `pending` if it's pending approval. Upon insertion, it represents the *intended* status of the link. Re-uploading a link with status `active` when it's still pending or with status `pending` when it's already active will have no effect: the status will remain unchanged. Re-uploading a link with deprecated status `inactive` is equivalent to not submitting the link at all and will delete the link if it was active or cancel the link request if it was pending. Acceptable values are: - "`active`" - "`pending`"
