The higher the boost, the higher the chance of false positive recognition as well. Negative boost values would correspond to anti-biasing. Anti-biasing is not enabled, so negative boost will simply be ignored. Though `boost` can accept a wide range of positive values, most use cases are best served with values between 0 (exclusive) and 20. We recommend using a binary search approach to finding the optimal value for your use case as well as adding phrases both with and without boost to your requests.
