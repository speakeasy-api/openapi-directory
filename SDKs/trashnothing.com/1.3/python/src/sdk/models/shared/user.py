The string will be one of the following:  no-recent-messages, negative-score, moderator, [days]-day-wait-for-negative <br /><br /> - **no-recent-messages**: The current user has not received any messages from this user in the last 30 days. <br /> - **negative-score**: The current user has a negative feedback and will not be able to leave feedback until their score is >= 0. <br /> - **moderator**: The user is a moderator and leaving feedback on moderators is not currently supported. <br /> - **[days]-day-wait-for-negative**: Positive feedback is not restricted but the current user must wait
      some number of days before they will be able to leave negative feedback on this user.  This string can 
      change depending on the number of days.  For example, when the current user must wait one day, the
      string will be '1-day-wait-for-negative'.  A wait is necessary because a lot of negative feedback results
      from communication issues that are resolved with more time.
