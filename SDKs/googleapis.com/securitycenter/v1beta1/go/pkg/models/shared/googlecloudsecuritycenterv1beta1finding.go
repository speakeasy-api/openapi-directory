// GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1beta1Finding - Security Command Center finding. A finding is a record of assessment data (security, risk, health or privacy) ingested into Security Command Center for presentation, notification, analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, an XSS vulnerability in an App Engine application is a finding.
type GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1beta1Finding struct {
	// The additional taxonomy group within findings from a given source. This field is immutable after creation time. Example: "XSS_FLASH_INJECTION"
	Category *string `json:"category,omitempty"`
	// The time at which the finding was created in Security Command Center.
	CreateTime *string `json:"createTime,omitempty"`
	// The time at which the event took place, or when an update to the finding occurred. For example, if the finding represents an open firewall it would capture the time the detector believes the firewall became open. The accuracy is determined by the detector. If the finding were to be resolved afterward, this time would reflect when the finding was resolved.

	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Immutable. The relative resource name of the source the finding belongs to. See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name This field is immutable after creation time. For example: "organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}"

See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name When the finding is for a non-Google Cloud resource, the resourceName can be a customer or partner defined string. This field is immutable after creation time.
