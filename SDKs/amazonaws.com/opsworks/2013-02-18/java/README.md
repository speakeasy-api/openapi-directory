* [assignInstance](docs/sdk/README.md#assigninstance) - <p>Assign a registered instance to a layer.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can assign registered on-premises instances to any layer type.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can assign registered Amazon EC2 instances only to custom layers.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot use this action with instances that were created with AWS OpsWorks Stacks.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html">Managing User Permissions</a>.</p>
* [assignVolume](docs/sdk/README.md#assignvolume) - <p>Assigns one of the stack's registered Amazon EBS volumes to a specified instance. The volume must first be registered with the stack by calling <a>RegisterVolume</a>. After you register the volume, you must call <a>UpdateVolume</a> to specify a mount point before calling <code>AssignVolume</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/resources.html">Resource Management</a>.</p> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.

* [rebootInstance](docs/sdk/README.md#rebootinstance) - <p>Reboots a specified instance.

* [registerElasticIp](docs/sdk/README.md#registerelasticip) - <p>Registers an Elastic IP address with a specified stack. An address can be registered with only one stack at a time.

* [registerInstance](docs/sdk/README.md#registerinstance) - <p>Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack.</p> <note> <p>We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. <code>RegisterInstance</code> handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI <code>register</code> command, which performs the entire registration operation.

For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register-registering-preparer.html"> Preparing the Instance</a>.</p> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage 
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally 
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
