  /**
   * Get a list of images
   *
   * @remarks
   * An image represents a piece of artwork attached to some entity like a series, season, or episode,
   * and is _owned_ by an entity called the `bucket`.
   * An image is also a container for several `MediaAssets` representing the physical files for various
   * styles used.
   *
   * ## Media Asset Styles for Images
   *
   * Most media assets use square images. You may upload and use a square image, or upload an image of any
   * shape and crop it to a square by specifying the cropping area. This area – identified by a coordinate
   * `x, y` and a `width` & `height` – is the portion of the image used for all cover art. If an image has
   * cropping defined, the cropped version of the image will be used in any `regular` or `square` style of media
   * asset. If the original file is rectangular and does not have cropping, then the system will use a squared
   * version of the original file with the smaller of width or height as the square size.
   *
   * The original image as uploaded into the system is always retained unmodified and available through
   * the style `original`. All media asset styles except `stripped-original` consist of the cropped image.
   *
   * An image has media assets with the following styles:
   *
   * - `original`: This is the original file provided. May not be available, depending on permissions
   *   and file type.
   * - `stripped-original`: The original file with all metadata (EXIF, XMP, PNG metadata, etc.) removed.
   *   This should be used for any application needing the original, uncropped, image.
   * - `regular`: If the image has cropping defined, this is the cropped image.
   *   If not, this is a square version of the original.
   * - `thumb`: A square thumbnail of the image with a size of `100x100` pixels.
   * - `square-400`: A square version of the image with a size of `400x400` pixels.
   * - `square-640`: A square version of the image with a size of `640x640` pixels.
   * - `square-888`: A square version of the image with a size of `888x888` pixels.
   * - `square-3000`: A square version of the image with a size of `3000x3000` pixels.
   *   This variant is only created if the cropped width & height are each at least 3000.
   * - `itunes`: A square version of the image with a size of `1400x1400` pixels.
   *
   * ### Preferred image used in feeds
   *
   * For the main series image used in feeds, it is ideal to use the `square-3000` version.
   * If that is not available, the `itunes` version should be used instead.
