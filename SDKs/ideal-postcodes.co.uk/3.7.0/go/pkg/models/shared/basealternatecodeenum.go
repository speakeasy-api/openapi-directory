// Base records (represented as "B") can represent a range of addresses or an individual address, such as a firm record, while alternate records (represented as "A") are individual delivery points. Base records are generally preferred over alternate records.
// Government deliveries will only be listed on alternate records with the appropriate government building indicator (federal, state, or city) set.
