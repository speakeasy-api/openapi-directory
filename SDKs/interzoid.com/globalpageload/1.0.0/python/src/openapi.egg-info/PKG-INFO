## Available Resources and Operations


### page_load_performance_time

* `globalpageload` - Gets page load (or an API call) performance from a specified global geography such as Paris, Tokyo, Virginia, Mumbai, Frankfurt, London, Seoul, California, Sao Paolo, and many more.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
