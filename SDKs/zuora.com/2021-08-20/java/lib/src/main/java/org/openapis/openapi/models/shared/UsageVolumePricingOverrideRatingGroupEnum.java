 *   * ByBillingPeriod (default): The rating is based on all the usages in a billing period.
 *   * ByUsageStartDate: The rating is based on all the usages on the same usage start date. 
 *   * ByUsageRecord: The rating is based on each usage record.
 *   * ByUsageUpload: The rating is based on all the usages in a uploaded usage file (.xls or .csv). If you import a mass usage in a single upload, which contains multiple usage files in .xls or .csv format, usage records are grouped for each usage file.
