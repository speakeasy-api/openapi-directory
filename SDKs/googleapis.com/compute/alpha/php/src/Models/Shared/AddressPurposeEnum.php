These addresses are regional resources. - `SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP` for an internal IP address that is assigned to multiple internal forwarding rules. - `PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT` for a private network address that is used to configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses can use this purpose.  */
