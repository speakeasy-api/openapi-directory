// PhysicalResourceIDContextKeyValuePair - Context information that enables CloudFormation to uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs in cases where a resource's logical and physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each context key-value pair specifies a resource that contains the targeted resource.
type PhysicalResourceIDContextKeyValuePair struct {
	Key   string
