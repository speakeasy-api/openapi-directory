The combination of a successful RPC status and an empty `report_errors` list indicates a complete success where all `Operations` in the request are processed successfully. 2. The combination of a successful RPC status and a non-empty `report_errors` list indicates a partial success where some `Operations` in the request succeeded. Each `Operation` that failed processing has a corresponding item in this list. 3. A failed RPC status indicates a general non-deterministic failure. When this happens, it's impossible to know which of the 'Operations' in the request succeeded or failed.
