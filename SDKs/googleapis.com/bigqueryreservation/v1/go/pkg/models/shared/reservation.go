Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignore_idle_slots is set to false.

The total slot_capacity of the reservation and its siblings may exceed the total slot_count of capacity commitments. In that case, the exceeding slots will be charged with the autoscale SKU. You can increase the number of baseline slots in a reservation every few minutes.

Otherwise, you can decrease your baseline slots every few minutes.
