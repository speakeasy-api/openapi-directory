## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `GetDeployments` - Use to get the active deployments from a device.
* `GetDeviceRegistration` - Use to check if a device is registered with SageMaker Edge Manager.
* `SendHeartbeat` - Use to get the current status of devices registered on SageMaker Edge Manager.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
