Use the freshness option property that best works with your data. For fileshare documents, last modified time is most relevant. For calendar event data, the time when the event occurs is a more relevant freshness indicator.

NOTE: \\"objecttype\\", \\"type\\" and \\"mimetype\\" are already supported. This property is to configure schema specific operators. Even though this is an array, only one operator can be specified. This is an array for future extensibility. Operators mapping to multiple properties within the same object are not supported. If the operator spans across different object types, this option has to be set once for each object definition."""
