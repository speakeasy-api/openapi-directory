     * @remarks
     * This is the means by which clients obtain access tokens to use the service. You can see how to construct an Ably TokenRequest in the [Ably TokenRequest spec](https://www.ably.io/documentation/rest-api/token-request-spec) documentation, although we recommend you use an Ably SDK rather to create a TokenRequest, as the construction of a TokenRequest is complex. The resulting token response object contains the token properties as defined in Ably TokenRequest spec. Authentication is not required if using a Signed TokenRequest.
