// DestinyDefinitionsDestinyItemIntrinsicSocketEntryDefinition - Represents a socket that has a plug associated with it intrinsically. This is useful for situations where the weapon needs to have a visual plug/Mod on it, but that plug/Mod should never change.
type DestinyDefinitionsDestinyItemIntrinsicSocketEntryDefinition struct {
	// If true, then this socket is visible in the item's "default" state. If you have an instance, you should always check the runtime state, as that can override this visibility setting: but if you're looking at the item on a conceptual level, this property can be useful for hiding data such as legacy sockets - which remain defined on items for infrastructure purposes, but can be confusing for users to see.
	DefaultVisible *bool
	// Indicates the plug that is intrinsically inserted into this socket.
	PlugItemHash *int64
	// Indicates the type of this intrinsic socket.
