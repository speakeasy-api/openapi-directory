Unfortunately, these two values may be (and are, for the case of important vendors like Xur) different.
    Issue https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/issues/353 is tracking a fix to start providing visibility date ranges where possible in addition to this refresh date, so that all important dates for vendors are available for use.
