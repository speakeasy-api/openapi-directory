/**
 * # Getting Started
 * 
 * ## Overview
 * 
 * ### Access
 * 
 * All API methods are either a `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS` request.
 * 
 * The API communicates over both HTTPS and plain HTTP using IPv4 and IPv6.
 * 
 * We recommend using HTTPS only although HTTP is available.
 * 
 * We use appropriate HTTP status codes where possible to indicate the request status.
 * 
 * ### Rate Limiting
 * 
 * Each IP address is rate limited at 30 requests per second. Tripping the rate limit will result in a 503 response.
 * 
 * The autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.
 * 
 * If you expect to breach the limit please contact us and we can move you to an endpoint with a higher limit.
 * 
 * ### JSONP
 * 
 * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) requests are supported. Include a `callback=` in your request as a query parameter. Your results return wrapped in a function designated by your request.
 * 
 * ## Authentication
 * 
 * Most requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:
 * 
 * ```
 * api.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/autocomplete/addresses?api_key=iddqd&amp;q=parkside
 * ```
 * 
 * Alternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization` header using the following scheme:
 * 
 * ```
 * Authorization: api_key="iddqd" [other_key="foo"]
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Versioning
 * 
 * This API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking changes under a new version.
 * 
 * Please note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:
 * 
 * - Adding new properties to existing API responses
 * - Adding new API endpoints
 * - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints
 * - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses
 * - Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format
 * 
 * ## Error Handling
 * 
 * A successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a response code of 2000 (found in the body).
 * 
 * An error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).
 * 
 * ## Testing
 * 
 * Each new account comes with a free test balance. Contact us if you need more for testing and integration.
 * 
 * ### Community Key
 * 
 * Our documentation and demos make heavy use of our community key `iddqd`. This allows for convenient access for trialing the API.
 * 
 * Many restrictions on this key are relaxed to allow developers make test requests. This key has a limit of 15 lookups per IP address per day as well as a daily usage cap. If you hit any limit restrictions, you can continue testing the API by creating a key of your own and using our free test methods.
 * 
 * Please be kind with the community key. We're trusting everyone to use it responsibly so that other developers may trial the API. Thank you!
 * 
 * ## Metadata
 * 
 * Requests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata. This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your requests [tagging](https://docs.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/docs/guides/tags).
 * 
 * # Response Codes
 * 
 * The API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each HTTP request.
 * 
 * The first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1 Specifications wherever possible.
 * 
 * `2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client and server errors respectively.
 * 
 * The second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code` property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when debugging.
 * 
 * Please use the glossary of code numbers and HTTP status codes below when debugging your requests.
 * 
 * ## 200 Request Success
 * 
 * | HTTP Code | API Code | Description                                  |
