	// Integer value that represents the archival state of a snapshot. 0 means the snapshot is not archived. 2 means the snapshot is archived. 3 means the snapshot is downloaded from the archival location. 4 means the snapshot is in the process of being downloaded from the archival location. 6 means the snapshot is stored locally and at the archival location.

	CloudState *int64 `json:"cloudState,omitempty"`
	// The current cloud storage tier of a snapshot. A snapshot's cloud storage tier determines how the cloud provider will determine storage and retrieval costs, as well as retrieval latency. Accepted values are Hot, Cool, AzureArchive (with Azure locations), Glacier, and GlacierDeepArchive (for AWS S3 locations). The value Cold has been deprecated in favor of AzureArchive, which is the recommended replacement value.
