// DeviceSelector - Selector for a device group. A selector consists of a set of conditions on the device that should all match (logical AND) to determine a device group eligibility. For instance, if a selector specifies RAM conditions, device model inclusion and device model exclusion, a device is considered to match if: device matches RAM conditions AND device matches one of the included device models AND device doesn't match excluded device models
type DeviceSelector struct {
	// Conditions about a device's RAM capabilities.
	DeviceRAM *DeviceRAM `json:"deviceRam,omitempty"`
	// Device models excluded by this selector, even if they match all other conditions.
	ExcludedDeviceIds []DeviceID `json:"excludedDeviceIds,omitempty"`
	// A device that has any of these system features is excluded by this selector, even if it matches all other conditions.
	ForbiddenSystemFeatures []SystemFeature `json:"forbiddenSystemFeatures,omitempty"`
	// Device models included by this selector.
	IncludedDeviceIds []DeviceID `json:"includedDeviceIds,omitempty"`
	// A device needs to have all these system features to be included by the selector.
	RequiredSystemFeatures []SystemFeature `json:"requiredSystemFeatures,omitempty"`
}
