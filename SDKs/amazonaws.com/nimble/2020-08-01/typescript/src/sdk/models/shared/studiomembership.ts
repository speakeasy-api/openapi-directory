These users have the permissions provided by the studio's user IAM role and do not appear in the studio membership collection. Only studio admins appear in studio membership.</p> <p>When you add a user to studio membership with the ADMIN persona, upon logging in to the Nimble Studio portal, they are granted permissions specified by the Studio's Admin IAM role.</p>
