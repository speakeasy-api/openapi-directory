## SDK Installation

### Composer

To install the SDK first add the below to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
composer update
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

## SDK Available Operations


### files

* `visionFilesAnnotate` - Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. Now only "application/pdf", "image/tiff" and "image/gif" are supported. This service will extract at most 5 (customers can specify which 5 in AnnotateFileRequest.pages) frames (gif) or pages (pdf or tiff) from each file provided and perform detection and annotation for each image extracted.
* `visionFilesAsyncBatchAnnotate` - Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of generic files, such as PDF files, which may contain multiple pages and multiple images per page. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateFilesResponse` (results).

### images

* `visionImagesAnnotate` - Run image detection and annotation for a batch of images.
* `visionImagesAsyncBatchAnnotate` - Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of images. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateImagesResponse` (results). This service will write image annotation outputs to json files in customer GCS bucket, each json file containing BatchAnnotateImagesResponse proto.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
