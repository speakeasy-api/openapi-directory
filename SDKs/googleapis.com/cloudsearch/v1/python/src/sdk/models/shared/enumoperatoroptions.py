class EnumOperatorOptions:
    r"""Used to provide a search operator for enum properties. This is optional. Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields relevant to the type of item being searched. For example, if you provide no operator for a *priority* enum property with possible values *p0* and *p1*, a query that contains the term *p0* returns items that have *p0* as the value of the *priority* property, as well as any items that contain the string *p0* in other fields. If you provide an operator name for the enum, such as *priority*, then search users can use that operator to refine results to only items that have *p0* as this property's value, with the query *priority:p0*."""

    r"""Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the enum property. For example, if operatorName is *priority* and the property's name is *priorityVal*, then queries like *priority:<value>* show results only where the value of the property named *priorityVal* matches *<value>*. By contrast, a search that uses the same *<value>* without an operator returns all items where *<value>* matches the value of any String properties or text within the content field for the item. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters."""
