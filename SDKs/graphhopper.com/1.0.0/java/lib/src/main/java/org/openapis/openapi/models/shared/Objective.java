public class Objective {
    /**
     * Type of objective function, i.e. `min` or `min-max`.
     * 
     *  * `min`: Minimizes the objective value.
     *  * `min-max`: Minimizes the maximum objective value.
     * 
     * For instance, `min` -&gt; `vehicles` minimizes the number of employed vehicles.
     * `min` -&gt; `completion_time` minimizes the sum of your vehicle routes' completion time.
     * 
     * If you use, for example, `min-max` -&gt; `completion_time`, it minimizes the maximum of your vehicle routes' completion time, i.e. it minimizes the overall makespan.
     * This only makes sense if you have more than one vehicle. In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.
     * If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that
     * the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours
     * to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,
     * this usually comes with higher transport costs.
     * 
     * If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:
     * 
     * ```json
     * "objectives" : [
     *    {
     *       "type": "min",
     *       "value": "vehicles"
     *    },
     *    {
     *       "type": "min",
     *       "value": "completion_time"
     *    }
     * ]
     * ```
     * 
     * If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:
     * 
     * ```json
     * "objectives" : [
     *    {
     *       "type": "min-max",
     *       "value": "completion_time"
     *    },
     *    {
     *       "type": "min-max",
     *       "value": "activities"
     *    }
     * ]
     * ```
     *

    /**
     * The value of the objective function.
     * The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time
     * your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.
     * The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,
     * i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.
     * Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in
     * scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.
     * The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.
