// ReplicationDirectionEnum - Replication direction designates if this is a failover replication, or a failback replication. When a DRS agent is installed on an instance, the replication direction is failover. In cases where a recovery launch was made in the recovery location and a new recovery instance was created, and then a failback replication was initiated from that recovery instance back to the origin location, then the replication direction will be failback.
