     * issueRefund - Issue Refund
     *
     * This method allows a seller (opted in to eBay Managed Payments) to issue a full or partial refund to a buyer for an order. Full or partial refunds can be issued at the order level or line item level. The refunds issued through this method are processed asynchronously, so the refund will not show as 'Refunded' right away. A seller will have to make a subsequent getOrder call to check the status of the refund. The status of an order refund can be found in the paymentSummary.refunds.refundStatus field of the getOrder response. Note: eBay Managed Payments is currently only available to a limited number of US sellers, but this program is scheduled to become available to more sellers throughout 2019 and beyond.
