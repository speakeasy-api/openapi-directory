// Offset - Offsets the position of an asset horizontally or vertically by a relative distance.
type Offset struct {
	// Offset an asset on the horizontal axis (left or right), range varies from -1 to 1. Positive numbers move the asset right, negative left. For all assets except titles the distance moved is relative to the width  of the viewport - i.e. an X offset of 0.5 will move the asset half the  screen width to the right.
	X *float32 `json:"x,omitempty"`
	// Offset an asset on the vertical axis (up or down), range varies from -1 to 1. Positive numbers move the asset up, negative down. For all assets except titles the distance moved is relative to the height  of the viewport - i.e. an Y offset of 0.5 will move the asset up half the  screen height.
	Y *float32 `json:"y,omitempty"`
