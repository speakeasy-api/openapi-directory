// SuggestedParagraphStyle - A suggested change to a ParagraphStyle.
type SuggestedParagraphStyle struct {
	// Styles that apply to a whole paragraph. Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message. A paragraph style's parent depends on where the paragraph style is defined: * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph inherits from the paragraph's corresponding named style type. * The ParagraphStyle on a named style inherits from the normal text named style. * The ParagraphStyle of the normal text named style inherits from the default paragraph style in the Docs editor. * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph element that's contained in a table may inherit its paragraph style from the table style. If the paragraph style does not inherit from a parent, unsetting fields will revert the style to a value matching the defaults in the Docs editor.
	ParagraphStyle *ParagraphStyle `json:"paragraphStyle,omitempty"`
	// A mask that indicates which of the fields on the base ParagraphStyle have been changed in this suggestion. For any field set to true, there's a new suggested value.
	ParagraphStyleSuggestionState *ParagraphStyleSuggestionState `json:"paragraphStyleSuggestionState,omitempty"`
