# SDK

## Overview

An Orchestration Layer that takes ISL services and packages them in a more targeted way for front-end applications.
This in turn makes client integration easier and reduces the complexity and size of front-end applications.

Rocket is also customisable - allowing UI engineers to ‘remix’ the existing back-end services into something that
best suits the application they are developing.
