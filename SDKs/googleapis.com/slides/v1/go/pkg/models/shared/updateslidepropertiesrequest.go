type UpdateSlidePropertiesRequest struct {
	// The fields that should be updated. At least one field must be specified. The root 'slideProperties' is implied and should not be specified. A single `"*"` can be used as short-hand for listing every field. For example to update whether a slide is skipped, set `fields` to `"isSkipped"`. To reset a property to its default value, include its field name in the field mask but leave the field itself unset.

	// The object ID of the slide the update is applied to.
	ObjectID *string `json:"objectId,omitempty"`
	// The properties of Page that are only relevant for pages with page_type SLIDE.
