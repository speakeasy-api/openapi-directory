## Available Resources and Operations


### organizations

* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_operations_list` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_create` - Creates Assured Workload.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_delete` - Deletes the workload. Make sure that workload's direct children are already in a deleted state, otherwise the request will fail with a FAILED_PRECONDITION error.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_list` - Lists Assured Workloads under a CRM Node.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_mutate_partner_permissions` - Update the permissions settings for an existing partner workload. For force updates don't set etag field in the Workload. Only one update operation per workload can be in progress.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_patch` - Updates an existing workload. Currently allows updating of workload display_name and labels. For force updates don't set etag field in the Workload. Only one update operation per workload can be in progress.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_restrict_allowed_resources` - Restrict the list of resources allowed in the Workload environment. The current list of allowed products can be found at https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/supported-products In addition to assuredworkloads.workload.update permission, the user should also have orgpolicy.policy.set permission on the folder resource to use this functionality.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_violations_acknowledge` - Acknowledges an existing violation. By acknowledging a violation, users acknowledge the existence of a compliance violation in their workload and decide to ignore it due to a valid business justification. Acknowledgement is a permanent operation and it cannot be reverted.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_violations_get` - Retrieves Assured Workload Violation based on ID.
* `assuredworkloads_organizations_locations_workloads_violations_list` - Lists the Violations in the AssuredWorkload Environment. Callers may also choose to read across multiple Workloads as per [AIP-159](https://google.aip.dev/159) by using '-' (the hyphen or dash character) as a wildcard character instead of workload-id in the parent. Format `organizations/{org_id}/locations/{location}/workloads/-`

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
