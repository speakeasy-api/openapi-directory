     * * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone

     *    account. For example, `alice@example.com` .
     *

     *    account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.

     *    identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For
     *    example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is
     *    recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user
     *    retains the role in the binding.

     *    deleted. For example,
     *    `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.
     *    If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
     *    `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the
     *    role in the binding.
     * 
     * * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
     *    identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently
     *    deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If
