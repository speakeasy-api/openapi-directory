## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `batch_detect_dominant_language` - Determines the dominant language of the input text for a batch of documents. For a list of languages that Amazon Comprehend can detect, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-languages.html">Amazon Comprehend Supported Languages</a>. 
* `batch_detect_entities` - Inspects the text of a batch of documents for named entities and returns information about them. For more information about named entities, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-entities.html">Entities</a> in the Comprehend Developer Guide. 
* `batch_detect_key_phrases` - Detects the key noun phrases found in a batch of documents.
* `batch_detect_sentiment` - Inspects a batch of documents and returns an inference of the prevailing sentiment, <code>POSITIVE</code>, <code>NEUTRAL</code>, <code>MIXED</code>, or <code>NEGATIVE</code>, in each one.
* `batch_detect_syntax` - Inspects the text of a batch of documents for the syntax and part of speech of the words in the document and returns information about them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-syntax.html">Syntax</a> in the Comprehend Developer Guide. 
* `batch_detect_targeted_sentiment` - <p>Inspects a batch of documents and returns a sentiment analysis for each entity identified in the documents.</p> <p>For more information about targeted sentiment, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-targeted-sentiment.html">Targeted sentiment</a>.</p>
* `classify_document` - <p>Creates a new document classification request to analyze a single document in real-time, using a previously created and trained custom model and an endpoint.</p> <p>You can input plain text or you can upload a single-page input document (text, PDF, Word, or image). </p> <p>If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input document, the API response includes an entry in <code>Errors</code> that describes the errors.</p> <p>If the system detects a document-level error in your input document, the API returns an <code>InvalidRequestException</code> error response. For details about this exception, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-inputs-sync-err.html"> Errors in semi-structured documents</a> in the Comprehend Developer Guide. </p>
* `contains_pii_entities` - Analyzes input text for the presence of personally identifiable information (PII) and returns the labels of identified PII entity types such as name, address, bank account number, or phone number.
* `create_dataset` - Creates a dataset to upload training or test data for a model associated with a flywheel. For more information about datasets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/flywheels-about.html"> Flywheel overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide</i>.
* `create_document_classifier` - Creates a new document classifier that you can use to categorize documents. To create a classifier, you provide a set of training documents that labeled with the categories that you want to use. After the classifier is trained you can use it to categorize a set of labeled documents into the categories. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-document-classification.html">Document Classification</a> in the Comprehend Developer Guide. 
* `create_endpoint` - Creates a model-specific endpoint for synchronous inference for a previously trained custom model For information about endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/manage-endpoints.html">Managing endpoints</a>.
* `create_entity_recognizer` - Creates an entity recognizer using submitted files. After your <code>CreateEntityRecognizer</code> request is submitted, you can check job status using the <code>DescribeEntityRecognizer</code> API. 
* `create_flywheel` - <p>A flywheel is an Amazon Web Services resource that orchestrates the ongoing training of a model for custom classification or custom entity recognition. You can create a flywheel to start with an existing trained model, or Comprehend can create and train a new model.</p> <p>When you create the flywheel, Comprehend creates a data lake in your account. The data lake holds the training data and test data for all versions of the model.</p> <p>To use a flywheel with an existing trained model, you specify the active model version. Comprehend copies the model's training data and test data into the flywheel's data lake.</p> <p>To use the flywheel with a new model, you need to provide a dataset for training data (and optional test data) when you create the flywheel.</p> <p>For more information about flywheels, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/flywheels-about.html"> Flywheel overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `delete_document_classifier` - <p>Deletes a previously created document classifier</p> <p>Only those classifiers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> will be returned.</p> <p>This is an asynchronous action that puts the classifier into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the classifier disappears from your account and is no longer available for use. </p>
* `delete_endpoint` - Deletes a model-specific endpoint for a previously-trained custom model. All endpoints must be deleted in order for the model to be deleted. For information about endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/manage-endpoints.html">Managing endpoints</a>.
* `delete_entity_recognizer` - <p>Deletes an entity recognizer.</p> <p>Only those recognizers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> will be returned.</p> <p>This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the recognizer disappears from your account and is no longer available for use. </p>
* `delete_flywheel` - <p>Deletes a flywheel. When you delete the flywheel, Amazon Comprehend does not delete the data lake or the model associated with the flywheel.</p> <p>For more information about flywheels, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/flywheels-about.html"> Flywheel overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide</i>.</p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
