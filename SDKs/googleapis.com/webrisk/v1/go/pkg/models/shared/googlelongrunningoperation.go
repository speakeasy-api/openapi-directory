// GoogleLongrunningOperation - This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
type GoogleLongrunningOperation struct {
	// If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
	Done *bool `json:"done,omitempty"`
	// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
	Error *GoogleRPCStatus `json:"error,omitempty"`
	// Contains a `SubmitUriMetadata` object.
	Metadata map[string]interface{} `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	// Matches the `/v1/{project-name}/operations/{operation-id}` pattern.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
	Response map[string]interface{} `json:"response,omitempty"`
