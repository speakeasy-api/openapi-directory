## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `delete_object` - Deletes an object at the specified path.
* `describe_object` - Gets the headers for an object at the specified path.
* `get_object` - Downloads the object at the specified path. If the object’s upload availability is set to <code>streaming</code>, AWS Elemental MediaStore downloads the object even if it’s still uploading the object.
* `list_items` - Provides a list of metadata entries about folders and objects in the specified folder.
* `put_object` - Uploads an object to the specified path. Object sizes are limited to 25 MB for standard upload availability and 10 MB for streaming upload availability.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
