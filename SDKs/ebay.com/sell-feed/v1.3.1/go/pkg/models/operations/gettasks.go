type GetTasksQueryParams struct {
	// Specifies the range of task creation dates used to filter the results. The results are filtered to include only tasks with a creation date that is equal to this date or is within specified range. Only tasks that are less than 90 days can be retrieved. Note: Maximum date range window size is 90 days. Valid Format (UTC):yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ..yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ For example: Tasks created on September 8, 2019 2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z..2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z
	DateRange *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=date_range"`
	// The feed type associated with the tasks to be returned. Only use a feedType that is available for your API: Order Feeds: LMS_ORDER_ACK, LMS_ORDER_REPORT Large Merchant Services (LMS) Feeds: See Available FeedTypes Do not use with the schedule_id parameter. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type.
	FeedType *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=feed_type"`
	// The maximum number of tasks that can be returned on each page of the paginated response. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves tasks 11 thru 20 from the result set. If this parameter is omitted, the default value is used. Default: 10 Maximum: 500
	Limit *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=limit"`
	// The number of previous days in which to search for tasks. Do not use with the date_range parameter. If both date_range and look_back_days are omitted, this parameter's default value is used. Default: 7 Range: 1-90 (inclusive)
	LookBackDays *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=look_back_days"`
	// The number of tasks to skip in the result set before returning the first task in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. If this query parameter is not set, the default value is used and the first page of records is returned. Default: 0
	Offset *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=offset"`
	// The schedule ID associated with the task. A schedule periodically generates a report for the feed type specified by the schedule template (see scheduleTemplateId in createSchedule). Do not use with the feed_type parameter. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type.
	ScheduleID *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=schedule_id"`
