## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `send_ssh_public_key` - Pushes an SSH public key to the specified EC2 instance for use by the specified user. The key remains for 60 seconds. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html">Connect to your Linux instance using EC2 Instance Connect</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.
* `send_serial_console_ssh_public_key` - Pushes an SSH public key to the specified EC2 instance. The key remains for 60 seconds, which gives you 60 seconds to establish a serial console connection to the instance using SSH. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-serial-console.html">EC2 Serial Console</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
