// InvoiceTypeOfInvoiceEnum - DEPRECATED. Do not use. This field is available for legacy reasons only. If you want to send a regular invoice (aka UBL type '380'), make sure you have a positive invoice amount. For a credit note (aka UBL type '381'), simply provide a negative invoice amount. If you, in addition to a negative invoice amount, also specify a billingReferences, your invoice will become a corrective invoice (aka UBL type '384'). If your invoice is not sent in the UBL syntax, Storecove will provide the appropriate type for the syntax the invoice is sent in.
