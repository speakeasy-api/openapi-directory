E.g., if you pivoted on the dimension `ga:browser` then you'd get k columns for \\"Firefox\\", k columns for \\"IE\\", k columns for \\"Chrome\\", etc. The ordering of the groups of columns is determined by descending order of \\"total\\" for the first of the k values. Ties are broken by lexicographic ordering of the first pivot dimension, then lexicographic ordering of the second pivot dimension, and so on. E.g., if the totals for the first value for Firefox, IE, and Chrome were 8, 2, 8, respectively, the order of columns would be Chrome, Firefox, IE. The following let you choose which of the groups of k columns are included in the response."""
