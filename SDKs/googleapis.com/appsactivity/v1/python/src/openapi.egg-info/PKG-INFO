## Available Resources and Operations


### activities

* `appsactivity_activities_list` - Returns a list of activities visible to the current logged in user. Visible activities are determined by the visibility settings of the object that was acted on, e.g. Drive files a user can see. An activity is a record of past events. Multiple events may be merged if they are similar. A request is scoped to activities from a given Google service using the source parameter.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
