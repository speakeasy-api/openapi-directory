     * - [prefix_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryPrefix)
     * - [range_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryRange)
     * - [sorted_attribute_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQuerySortedAttribute)

     * All other query types cannot be combined with any others.
     * 
     * When a query filter is based on an attribute, the attribute must be searchable.
     * Searchable attributes are listed as follows, along their parent types that can be searched for with applicable query filters.
     * 
     * * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
     * - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
     * - `description`: `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
     * - `abbreviation`: `CatalogItem`
     * - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
     * - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
     * - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
     * - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`
     * 
     * For example, to search for [CatalogItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogItem) objects by searchable attributes, you can use
     * the `"name"`, `"description"`, or `"abbreviation"` attribute in an applicable query filter.
