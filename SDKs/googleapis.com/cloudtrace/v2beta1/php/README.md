### projects

* `cloudtraceProjectsTraceSinksCreate` - Creates a sink that exports trace spans to a destination. The export of newly-ingested traces begins immediately, unless the sink's `writer_identity` is not permitted to write to the destination. A sink can export traces only from the resource owning the sink (the 'parent').
* `cloudtraceProjectsTraceSinksDelete` - Deletes a sink.
* `cloudtraceProjectsTraceSinksGet` - Get a trace sink by name under the parent resource (GCP project).
* `cloudtraceProjectsTraceSinksList` - List all sinks for the parent resource (GCP project).
* `cloudtraceProjectsTraceSinksPatch` - Updates a sink. This method updates fields in the existing sink according to the provided update mask. The sink's name cannot be changed nor any output-only fields (e.g. the writer_identity).

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
