## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `batch_get_collection` - Returns attributes for one or more collections, including the collection endpoint and the OpenSearch Dashboards endpoint. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-manage.html">Creating and managing Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections</a>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
