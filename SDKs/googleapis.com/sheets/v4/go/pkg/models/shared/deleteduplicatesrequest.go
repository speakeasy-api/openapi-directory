// DeleteDuplicatesRequest - Removes rows within this range that contain values in the specified columns that are duplicates of values in any previous row. Rows with identical values but different letter cases, formatting, or formulas are considered to be duplicates. This request also removes duplicate rows hidden from view (for example, due to a filter). When removing duplicates, the first instance of each duplicate row scanning from the top downwards is kept in the resulting range. Content outside of the specified range isn't removed, and rows considered duplicates do not have to be adjacent to each other in the range.
type DeleteDuplicatesRequest struct {
	// The columns in the range to analyze for duplicate values. If no columns are selected then all columns are analyzed for duplicates.
	ComparisonColumns []DimensionRange `json:"comparisonColumns,omitempty"`
	// A range on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open, i.e. the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive -- [start_index, end_index). Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side. For example, if `"Sheet1"` is sheet ID 123456, then: `Sheet1!A1:A1 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 0, end_row_index: 1, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 1` `Sheet1!A3:B4 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 2, end_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A5:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1 == sheet_id: 123456` The start index must always be less than or equal to the end index. If the start index equals the end index, then the range is empty. Empty ranges are typically not meaningful and are usually rendered in the UI as `#REF!`.
