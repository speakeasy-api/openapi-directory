## Available Resources and Operations


### agentUsers

* `homegraphAgentUsersDelete` - Unlinks the given third-party user from your smart home Action. All data related to this user will be deleted. For more details on how users link their accounts, see [fulfillment and authentication](https://developers.home.google.com/cloud-to-cloud/primer/fulfillment). The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see DeleteAgentUserRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.

### devices

* `homegraphDevicesQuery` - Gets the current states in Home Graph for the given set of the third-party user's devices. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see QueryRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `homegraphDevicesReportStateAndNotification` - Reports device state and optionally sends device notifications. Called by your smart home Action when the state of a third-party device changes or you need to send a notification about the device. See [Implement Report State](https://developers.home.google.com/cloud-to-cloud/integration/report-state) for more information. This method updates the device state according to its declared [traits](https://developers.home.google.com/cloud-to-cloud/primer/device-types-and-traits). Publishing a new state value outside of these traits will result in an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error response. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see ReportStateAndNotificationRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `homegraphDevicesRequestSync` - Requests Google to send an `action.devices.SYNC` [intent](https://developers.home.google.com/cloud-to-cloud/intents/sync) to your smart home Action to update device metadata for the given user. The third-party user's identity is passed via the `agent_user_id` (see RequestSyncDevicesRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `homegraphDevicesSync` - Gets all the devices associated with the given third-party user. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see SyncRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
