## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `get_personalized_ranking` - <p>Re-ranks a list of recommended items for the given user. The first item in the list is deemed the most likely item to be of interest to the user.</p> <note> <p>The solution backing the campaign must have been created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING.</p> </note>
* `get_recommendations` - <p>Returns a list of recommended items. For campaigns, the campaign's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is required and the required user and item input depends on the recipe type used to create the solution backing the campaign as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>USER_PERSONALIZATION - <code>userId</code> required, <code>itemId</code> not used</p> </li> <li> <p>RELATED_ITEMS - <code>itemId</code> required, <code>userId</code> not used</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>Campaigns that are backed by a solution created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING use the API.</p> </note> <p> For recommenders, the recommender's ARN is required and the required item and user input depends on the use case (domain-based recipe) backing the recommender. For information on use case requirements see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-use-cases.html">Choosing recommender use cases</a>. </p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
