	// Specifies the number of promotions to skip in the result set before returning the first promotion in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0
	Offset *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=offset"`
	// Limits the results to the promotions that are in the state specified by this query parameter. Valid values: DRAFT SCHEDULED RUNNING PAUSED ENDEDMaximum number of values supported: 1

	// Filters the returned promotions in the report based on their campaign promotion type. Specify one of the following values to indicate the promotion type you want returned in the report: CODED_COUPON &ndash; A coupon code promotion set with createItemPromotion. MARKDOWN_SALE &ndash; A markdown promotion set with createItemPriceMarkdownPromotion. ORDER_DISCOUNT &ndash; A threshold promotion set with createItemPromotion.

Example: &quot;iPhone&quot; or &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; Commas that separate keywords are ignored. For example, a keyword string of &quot;iPhone, iPad&quot; equals &quot;iPhone iPad&quot;, and each results in a response that contains promotions with both &quot;iPhone&quot; and &quot;iPad&quot; in the title.
