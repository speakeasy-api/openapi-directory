	// Strongly validated etag for optimistic concurrency control. Preserve the value returned from `GetAppProfile` when calling `UpdateAppProfile` to fail the request if there has been a modification in the mean time. The `update_mask` of the request need not include `etag` for this protection to apply. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) and [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3) for more details.
	Etag *string `json:"etag,omitempty"`
	// Read/write requests are routed to the nearest cluster in the instance, and will fail over to the nearest cluster that is available in the event of transient errors or delays. Clusters in a region are considered equidistant. Choosing this option sacrifices read-your-writes consistency to improve availability.
