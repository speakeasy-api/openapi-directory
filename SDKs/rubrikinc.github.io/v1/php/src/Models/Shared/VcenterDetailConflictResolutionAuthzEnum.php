/** Set to 'AllowAutoConflictResolution' to link the relic virtual machine objects of a virtual machine to the current object for the virtual machine or to 'NoConflictResolution' to prevent linking. The Rubrik cluster generates a unique ID for each virtual machine when a vCenter Server is added. When a virtual machine changes to another vCenter Server or unregisters and registers with the same vCenter Server, a new unique ID is generated for that virtual machine. When this happens, the virtual machine object associated with the original ID becomes a relic. This option links relic virtual machine objects with the current virtual machine object of a specific virtual machine, and makes the collective snapshot history available through the current object. Default value is 'NoConflictResolution'. */
