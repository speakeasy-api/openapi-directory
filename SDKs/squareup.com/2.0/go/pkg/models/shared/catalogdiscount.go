// CatalogDiscount - A discount applicable to items.
type CatalogDiscount struct {
	// Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.
	// Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are
	// considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the
	// sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See
	// [Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)
	// for more information.
	AmountMoney *Money `json:"amount_money,omitempty"`
	// Indicates whether the discount is a fixed amount or percentage, or entered at the time of sale.
	DiscountType *string `json:"discount_type,omitempty"`
	// The color of the discount display label in the Square Point of Sale app. This must be a valid hex color code.
	LabelColor *string `json:"label_color,omitempty"`
	// Indicates whether this discount should reduce the price used to calculate tax.
	//
	// Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some circumstances taxes must
	// be calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular discount. For example,
	// in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a
	// customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is
	// due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have
	// `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.
	//
	// If you are unsure whether you need to use this field, consult your tax professional.
	ModifyTaxBasis *string `json:"modify_tax_basis,omitempty"`
	// The discount name. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters, and its value length is of Unicode code points.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The percentage of the discount as a string representation of a decimal number, using a `.` as the decimal
	// separator and without a `%` sign. A value of `7.5` corresponds to `7.5%`. Specify a percentage of `0` if `discount_type`
	// is `VARIABLE_PERCENTAGE`.
	//
	// Do not use this field for amount-based or variable discounts.
	Percentage *string `json:"percentage,omitempty"`
	// Indicates whether a mobile staff member needs to enter their PIN to apply the
	// discount to a payment in the Square Point of Sale app.
	PinRequired *bool `json:"pin_required,omitempty"`
