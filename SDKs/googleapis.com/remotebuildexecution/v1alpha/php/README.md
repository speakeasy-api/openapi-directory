### projects

* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesCreate` - Creates a new instance in the specified region. Returns a long running operation which contains an instance on completion. While the long running operation is in progress, any call to `GetInstance` returns an instance in state `CREATING`.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesList` - Lists instances in a project.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesTestNotify` - Sends a test notification to the specified instance. Returns a `google.protobuf.Empty` on success.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesWorkerpoolsCreate` - Creates a new worker pool with a specified size and configuration. Returns a long running operation which contains a worker pool on completion. While the long running operation is in progress, any call to `GetWorkerPool` returns a worker pool in state `CREATING`.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesWorkerpoolsDelete` - Deletes the specified worker pool. Returns a long running operation, which contains a `google.protobuf.Empty` response on completion. While the long running operation is in progress, any call to `GetWorkerPool` returns a worker pool in state `DELETING`.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesWorkerpoolsList` - Lists worker pools in an instance.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsInstancesWorkerpoolsPatch` - Updates an existing worker pool with a specified size and/or configuration. Returns a long running operation, which contains a worker pool on completion. While the long running operation is in progress, any call to `GetWorkerPool` returns a worker pool in state `UPDATING`.
* `remotebuildexecutionProjectsOperationsGet` - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
