    r"""Welcome to WealthOS. Here you will find the comprehensive set of information you need to rapidly build rich digital wealth management features.
    # Getting Started
    Before you start developing your features using the WealthOS API, please make sure that the following steps are complete:
    
    * Set-up your own environment unique to your organisation using the link we have provided
    * Follow the step-by-step [guide](/admin/docs/guide) to configuring your environment
    * Sign-up and obtain keys for sandbox environments of all 3rd party integrations you require from the market place of available integrations in WealthOS
    * Setup the keys of the 3rd party integrations within the WealthOS Admin UI
    
    Once you have set yourself up, you can add other users who will be able to collaborate with you.

    # WealthOS API Basics
    The WealthOS API is a RESTful API that provides synchronous communication between your application and the WealthOS platform. For some calls where WealthOS communicates with a 3rd party application (e.g. KYC providers, Payment providers, Custodians) thus causing asynchronicity in communication, WealthOS also provides anebsocket API so you do not have to build a polling function to retrieve responses. 
    
    Your API URLs will be in the following formats:
    
    **RESTful API** - https://{unique_tenancy_identifier}.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/tenant/{endpoint}/v1
    
    ```           E.g. https://acorn-gb.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/investors/v1```
    
    **Websocket API** - wss://{unique_tenancy_identifier}-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/ws/
    
    ```           E.g. wss://acorn-gb-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/ws/```
    
    The Websocket API is used by WealthOS to push asynchronous notifications to your application.
    
    ---
    # Authentication
    The wealth management organisation is granted a **secret key** that they must use in their API calls to interact with the WealthOS platform securely. This key must be stored securely only in your application server side code. It grants the highest level of access privileges to the WealthOS platform. 
    <!-- Each wealth management organisation is granted a set of keys that they must use in their API calls to interact with the WealthOS platform securely.
    
     There are two (2) types of API keys:
    
     * The **secret key**. This must be stored securely only in your application server side code. It grants the highest level of access privileges to the WealthOS platform. 
    
     * **Publishable keys**. These are temporary keys with a short life span issued specifically for some activities. These have limited privileges in terms of what types of calls are permitted to be made using them. Usually these are sent as a response to another API call (e.g. creating a payment intent)
    -->
    ## Testing your keys
    You may test your keys by calling on the following endpoints. 
    
    ### RESTful API
    To test the **secret key**:&nbsp;Perform a GET call on ```~/tenant/test/hello-world-be```
    <!--
    To test the **temporary key**:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform a GET call on ```~/tenant/test/hello-world-gui```
    -->
    ### Socket API
     In order for WealthOS to authenticate a Websocket API call, a query parameter x-token must be included within the URL. 
    
    x-token = your organisation’s secret key 
    
    Full URL must read as follows: 
    ````
    wss://{unique_tenancy_identifier}-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/ws?x-token=<api_secret_key>
    ````
    ---
    # Idempotency
    Some of the capabilities exposed via WealthOS tenant API needs to be idempotant (from the perspective of the system). For those requests an additional field `request_id` is required to be sent with the request. The purpose of the `request_id` is to give an unique id for the request, so the system can differentiate requests. Advantage of the `request_id` is the system can check whether the request have already reached the system. If a request (that should be idempotant) has already reached the system, the duplicate request will be rejected.
    
    #### Sample response
    
    ```json
    
    {
      \"status\": 409,
      \"body\": {
        \"message\" : \"duplicate request\", 
        \"status\" : \"COMPLETE|PROCESSING\", 
        \"response\" : \"<stringified original response body>\"
      }
    }
    
    ```
    The `request_id` stored for idempotency checks will be deleted after <span style=\"color:red\">**1 hour**</span> after which point a message with the same `request_id` will be considered as a new request.
    
    ---
    # Entity Versioning
    WealthOS maintains versioning for reference data entities stored within the platform which can be updated by the Wealth Manager BE. This is to ensure integrity of data in the event the same entity is being updated by multiple users via the API. 
    
    When requesting for an entity via the API the system will return the latest  `reference_version` which must be provided when the Wealth Manager BE is updating an entity. If the received `reference_version` is different to the latest `reference_version` in the system, the update will be rejected.
    
    With each sucessful update done to the entity via the API the system will increment the  `reference_version`. 
    
    ---
    # Limits
    
    Currently there are limits to the number of requests that can be made to the WealthOS API. Following are these limits:
    * Average requests per second       1000
    * Burst requests                    500
    * Total requests per day            10,000

    # FAQ
    
    - **How do I see my API keys and how do I re-new the keys?**
        - Your API keys are displayed in the developer section of the WOS Admin GUI. You have to be of user type 'developer' or 'admin' to see this. 
    
    - **Is it mandatory to connect to the web socket**
        - Right now this is optional. However it is highly recommended to do so, because the wealth manager BE can avoid polling (Remember: the REST API calls have a daily quota) for certain important events.
    
    ---
    # Socket API
    ## Intro
    Web socket API is used by the WOS system to notify (push) asynchronous events to the Wealth Manager BE
    ## Accessing the Socket api
    Your Socket API URL would be wss://{socket api root}/ws
    
    For example lets assume your env is `gb` and tenant id is `acorn`. Then,
    
    - Socket API Root: acorn-gb-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud
    
    - Socket API URL: wss://acorn-gb-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/ws
    ## Authenticating Socket Connection
    WealthOS requires to authenticate the web socket connection before allowing you to communicate with the system through the socket. For that purpose WealthOS socket API expects a query parameter `x-token` to be attached with the socket URL.
    
    `x-token` is the ApiSecretKey given you by the WealthOS system
    
    So the actual connection URL must look like
    
    ```
    wss://acme-gb-ws.sandbox.wealthos.cloud/ws?x-token=<api_secret_key>
    ```
    ## Channels
    WealthOS socket api uses the concept of channels to group messages exchanged through web socket. A single socket connection may be used to handle one or many channels. Users are advised to implement a proper load balancing scheme.
    
    Messages sent via the channels will be strictly ordered by the event generation time. However, there is no guarantee of ordering messages across channels.
    
    A generic data message passed through the socket looks like,
    
    ```json
    {
        type: \"a string tag that identifies the message\"
        resend: \"[optional] Indicates whether this is a resend message. Resends can be sent during explicit recovery servicing or due to server recovering from errors\"
        ch: \"channel name\" 
        payload: { 
            .... 
        }
        id: \"unique id for this message\"
        ts: \"unique sequence number of message\"
        
    }
    ``` 
    **Note**: The unique sequence number `ts` is a strictly monotonically increasing timestamp (milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This is unique per channel.
    ## Subscribe
    Sent from client to server to subscribe to a channel.
      * Channel name should be specified in the `ch` attribute.
      * Unique request id must be sent in the `req_id` attribute.
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"subscription\",
        \"ch\": \"channel to be subscribed\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"from_ts\": past sequence number / Timestamp value (milliseconds)
    }
    ```
    Server responds with a **subscribe** message which echoes the request. In addition, a **status** field indicates the subscription status (success or failed) and aneason field indicating the reason in the case of a failure.
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"subscription\",
        \"ch\": \"subscribed channel\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"status\": \"ACK\"
    }
    ```
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"subscription\",
        \"ch\": \"subscribed channel\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"status\": \"NACK\",
        \"reason\": \"Error Message\"
    }
    ```
    ## Unsubscribe
    Sent from client to server to unsubscribe from a channel.
      * Channel name should be specified in the `ch` attribute.
      * Unique request id must be sent in the `req_id` attribute.
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"unsubscription\",
        \"ch\": \"channel to be unsubscribed\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\"
    }
    ```
    Server responds with a **unsubscribe** message which echoes the request. In addition, a **status** field indicates the unsubscription status (success or failed) and aneason field indicating the reason in the case of a failure.
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"unsubscription\",
        \"ch\": \"channel to be unsubscribed\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"status\": \"ACK\"
    }
    ```
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"unsubscription\",
        \"ch\": \"channel to be unsubscribed\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"status\": \"NACK\",
        \"reason\": \"Error Message\"
    }
    ```
    **NOTE**
    * Subscribing to an already subscribed channel will be rejected.
    * Client is expected to re-try, if no response is received within 60 secs
     <!--Server will only cache messages for 1 day.-->
    
    ## Heart beats
    The ws client must send a 'heart-beat'  to the server every **60 seconds** to keep the socket connection alive. Server will reply back with heat-beat (HB). Server will disconnect the ws connection if no HBs are recived for **3 HB intervals** (i.e. between 2 to 3 minutes). Client should also disconnet if no data or hb message is received for 3 minutes
    
    ```json
    {
        type: \"hb\",
        ch: \"system\"
    }
    ```
    <div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#FFD2D2; color:#D8000C;'>
        <span>
            <p style='margin-top:0.9em;margin-bottom:0.9em;margin-left:1em; text-align:left'>
                <b>ⓘ</b> A live socket connection will be automatically disconnected by the server after 2 hours
            </p>
        </span>
    </div>
    
    
    ## Recover missed updates
    The ws client can send a **past sequence number** with the subscription to receive missed updates from the provided sequence number onwards.
    
    ```json
    {
        \"type\": \"subscription\",
        \"ch\": \"channel to be subscribed\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"from_ts\": \"past sequence number\"
    }
    ```
    Server responds with a **subscribe** message which echoes the request. Then the ws client will receive past socket updates from the provided sequence number onwards.
    
    ```
    {
        \"type\": \"subscription\",
        \"ch\": \"subscribed channel\",
        \"req_id\": \"request ID\",
        \"status\": \"ACK\",
        \"from_ts\": 1625660972000
    }
    {
        \"type\": \"investor_status\",
        \"ch\": \"investors\",
        \"payload\": {
            \"investor_id\" : \"<investor_id>\",
            \"status\" : \"'fail' | 'success'\", 
            \"error\" : \"\",  
            \"event\": \"'kyc.started' | 'kyc.completed'\" 
        },
        \"id\": \"fd232671-d47b-4ae2-a4c4-0a37258ffae5\",
        \"ts\": 1625660972222,
        \"resend\": true
    }
    ```
    **NOTE**
    * If the provided sequence number equals **-1**, Then the system will send all the past socket updates to the client.
    * System only accepts integer type sequence number values.

For cash holdings, `free_quantity` and `free_value` will return the cash that is settled and available, while `locked_quantity` and `locked_value`  returns the value of cash which is locked (i.e unsettled, ringfenced for a fee deduction etc.) and cannot be used.`total_quantity` and `total_value` will be the total of free and locked. 
    
    * Investment Products : For investment product holdings,  `total_quantity`  return the total number of units held of an investment product within the pot, `locked-quantity` returns the total number of unit which are locked (e.g. ringfenced to be sold) and `free-quantity` returns number of units available for trading. Value of the holdings are calculated using latest available price. So the formula to calculate the value of the investment products holdings will be `quantity`*`price`.
