// CustomerTextFilter - A filter to select customers based on exact or fuzzy matching of
// customer attributes against a specified query. Depending on the customer attributes,
// the filter can be case-sensitive. This filter can be exact or fuzzy, but it cannot be both.
type CustomerTextFilter struct {
	// Use the exact filter to select customers whose attributes match exactly the specified query.
	Exact *string `json:"exact,omitempty"`
	// Use the fuzzy filter to select customers whose attributes match the specified query
	// in a fuzzy manner. When the fuzzy option is used, search queries are tokenized, and then
	// each query token must be matched somewhere in the searched attribute. For single token queries,
	// this is effectively the same behavior as a partial match operation.
	Fuzzy *string `json:"fuzzy,omitempty"`
