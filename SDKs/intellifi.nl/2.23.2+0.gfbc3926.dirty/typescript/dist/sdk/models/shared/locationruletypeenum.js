 * Disallow: items at `conditions.from_location` cannot be moved to `conditions.to_location` and locations disallowed in other `disallow` rules (destination blacklist).
 * Disappeared: items disappearing at `conditions.from_location` will be moved to `parameters.location` after `parameters.time_s` seconds.
 * Debounce: items moves from `conditions.from_location` (and optionally to `conditions.to_location`) will be debounced with a period of `parameters.time_s` seconds, for a maximum of `parameters.max_periods` periods.
