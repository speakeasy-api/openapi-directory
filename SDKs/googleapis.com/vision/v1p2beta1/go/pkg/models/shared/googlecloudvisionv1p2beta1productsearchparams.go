// GoogleCloudVisionV1p2beta1ProductSearchParams - Parameters for a product search request.
type GoogleCloudVisionV1p2beta1ProductSearchParams struct {
	// A bounding polygon for the detected image annotation.
	BoundingPoly *GoogleCloudVisionV1p2beta1BoundingPoly `json:"boundingPoly,omitempty"`
	// The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key. An '=' should be used to connect the key and value. For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is acceptable, but "(color = red OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable. "color: red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':' instead of an '='.
	Filter *string `json:"filter,omitempty"`
	// The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider the first category, and either "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", "toys-v2", "packagedgoods-v1", or "general-v1" should be specified. The legacy categories "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still supported but will be deprecated. For new products, please use "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", or "toys-v2" for better product search accuracy. It is recommended to migrate existing products to these categories as well.
	ProductCategories []string `json:"productCategories,omitempty"`
	// The resource name of a ProductSet to be searched for similar images. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID`.
	ProductSet *string `json:"productSet,omitempty"`
