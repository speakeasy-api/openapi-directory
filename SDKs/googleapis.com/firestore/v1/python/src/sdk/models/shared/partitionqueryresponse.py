The partition cursors will be ordered according to same ordering as the results of the query supplied to PartitionQuery. For example, if a PartitionQuery request returns partition cursors A and B, running the following three queries will return the entire result set of the original query: * query, end_at A * query, start_at A, end_at B * query, start_at B An empty result may indicate that the query has too few results to be partitioned."""
