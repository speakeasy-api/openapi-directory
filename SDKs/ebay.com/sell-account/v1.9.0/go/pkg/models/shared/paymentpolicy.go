type PaymentPolicy struct {
	// This container indicates whether the fulfillment policy applies to motor vehicle listings, or if it applies to non-motor vehicle listings.
	CategoryTypes []CategoryType `json:"categoryTypes,omitempty"`

	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// A type used to specify a period of time using a specified time-measurement unit. Payment, return, and fulfillment business policies all use this type to specify time windows.<br/><br/>Whenever a container that uses this type is used in a request, both of these fields are required. Similarly, whenever a container that uses this type is returned in a response, both of these fields are always returned.
	FullPaymentDueIn *TimeDuration `json:"fullPaymentDueIn,omitempty"`
	// If this field is returned as <code>true</code>, immediate payment is required from the buyer for: <ul><li>A fixed-price item</li><li>An auction item where the buyer uses the 'Buy it Now' option</li><li>A deposit for a motor vehicle listing</li></ul><br />It is possible for the seller to set this field as <code>true</code> in the payment business policy, but it will not apply in some scenarios. For example, immediate payment is not applicable for auction listings that have a winning bidder, for buyer purchases that involve the Best Offer feature, or for transactions that happen offline between the buyer and seller.
	ImmediatePay *bool `json:"immediatePay,omitempty"`

	PaymentInstructions *string `json:"paymentInstructions,omitempty"`
	// This container is returned to show the payment methods that are accepted for the payment business policy.  <br><br>Sellers do not have to specify any electronic payment methods for listings, so this array will often be returned empty unless the payment business policy is intended for motor vehicle listings or other items in categories where offline payments are required or supported.
	PaymentMethods []PaymentMethod `json:"paymentMethods,omitempty"`
	// A unique eBay-assigned ID for a payment business policy. This ID is generated when the policy is created.
