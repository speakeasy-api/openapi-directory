 * Add room selling to your app with ease, or expand your existing hotel portfolio. Access all the marketing material you need to sell a room, from hotel amenities to images.

 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Getting started is easy:
 *
 * > **1. Sign-up within seconds**: Head to the [Impala website](https://impala.travel), enter your details and receive your sandbox API key immediately (no credit card needed).
 *
 * > **2. Start building within minutes**: Build against a sandbox API with realistic test data. Use a [step-by-step walkthrough](https://impala.travel) to see what's possible. Check for available hotels and their rates. Make and manage fake bookings without any risk. Add room booking to your existing website or app, or start an online travel agency from scratch.
