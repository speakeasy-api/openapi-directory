When using end-to-end encryption, several features (e.g. cloud recording, phone/SIP/H.323 dial-in) will be **automatically disabled**. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The value of this field can be one of the following:&lt;br&gt;
     * `enhanced_encryption`: Enhanced encryption. Encryption is stored in the cloud if you enable this option. &lt;br&gt;
     * 
     * `e2ee`: [End-to-end encryption](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360048660871). The encryption key is stored in your local device and can not be obtained by anyone else. Enabling this setting also **disables** the following features: join before host, cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, breakout rooms, polling, 1:1 private chat, and meeting reactions.
