     * The set of opt in feature flags which cause breaking changes to responses.

     * 
     * While Rocket APIs look to avoid breaking changes under the active major version, the formats of responses
     * may need to evolve over this time.
     * 
     * These feature flags allow clients to select which response formats they expect and avoid breaking
     * clients as these formats evolve under the current major version.
     * 
     * ### Flags
     * 
     * - `all` - Enable all flags. Useful for testing. _Don't use in production_.
     * - `idp` - Dynamic item detail pages with schedulable rows.
     * - `ldp` - Dynamic list detail pages with schedulable rows.
     * - `hb` - Hubble formatted image urls.
     * - `rpt` - Updated resume point threshold logic.
     * - `cas` - "Custom Asset Search", inlcude `customAssets` in search results.
     * - `lrl` - Do not pre-populate related list if more than `max_list_prefetch` down the page.
     * - `cd` - Custom Destination support.
     * 
     * See the `feature-flags.md` for available flag details.

     * likely to have any effect. While it may still be useful in some cases, most of the time the season
     * selection will be dictated by the configuration of the rows scheduled on the show detail page.

     * provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show embedded in the page.
     * 
     * The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
     * `item_detail_select_season=latest` along with `item_detail_expand=all`. This would then return the
