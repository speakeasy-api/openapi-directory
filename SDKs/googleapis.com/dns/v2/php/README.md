### changes

* `dnsChangesCreate` - Atomically updates the ResourceRecordSet collection.
* `dnsChangesGet` - Fetches the representation of an existing Change.
* `dnsChangesList` - Enumerates Changes to a ResourceRecordSet collection.

### dnsKeys

* `dnsDnsKeysGet` - Fetches the representation of an existing DnsKey.
* `dnsDnsKeysList` - Enumerates DnsKeys to a ResourceRecordSet collection.

### managedZoneOperations

* `dnsManagedZoneOperationsGet` - Fetches the representation of an existing Operation.
* `dnsManagedZoneOperationsList` - Enumerates Operations for the given ManagedZone.

* `dnsManagedZonesDelete` - Deletes a previously created ManagedZone.
* `dnsManagedZonesGet` - Fetches the representation of an existing ManagedZone.
* `dnsManagedZonesGetIamPolicy` - Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
