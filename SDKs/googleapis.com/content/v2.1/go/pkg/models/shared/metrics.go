	// Average order size - the average number of items in an order. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
	Aos *float64 `json:"aos,omitempty"`
	// Average order value in micros (1 millionth of a standard unit, 1 USD = 1000000 micros) - the average value (total price of items) of all placed orders. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
	AovMicros *float64 `json:"aovMicros,omitempty"`
	// Number of clicks.
	Clicks *string `json:"clicks,omitempty"`
	// Number of conversions divided by the number of clicks, reported on the impression date. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program.

	// Value of conversions in micros (1 millionth of a standard unit, 1 USD = 1000000 micros) attributed to the product, reported on the conversion date. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment.

	// Number of conversions attributed to the product, reported on the conversion date. Depending on the attribution model, a conversion might be distributed across multiple clicks, where each click gets its own credit assigned. This metric is a sum of all such credits. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program.
	Conversions *float64 `json:"conversions,omitempty"`
	// Click-through rate - the number of clicks merchant's products receive (clicks) divided by the number of times the products are shown (impressions).
