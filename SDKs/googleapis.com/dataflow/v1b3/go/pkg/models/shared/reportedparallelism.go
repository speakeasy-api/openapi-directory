// ReportedParallelism - Represents the level of parallelism in a WorkItem's input, reported by the worker.
type ReportedParallelism struct {
	// Specifies whether the parallelism is infinite. If true, "value" is ignored. Infinite parallelism means the service will assume that the work item can always be split into more non-empty work items by dynamic splitting. This is a work-around for lack of support for infinity by the current JSON-based Java RPC stack.
	IsInfinite *bool `json:"isInfinite,omitempty"`
