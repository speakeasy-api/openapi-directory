/**
 * Specifies the sales channel, through which the shopper gives their card details, and whether the shopper is a returning customer.
 * 
 * For the web service API, Adyen assumes Ecommerce shopper interaction by default.
 * 
 * This field has the following possible values:
 * * `Ecommerce` - Online transactions where the cardholder is present (online). For better authorisation rates, we recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request.
 * * `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the card holder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment).
 * * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone.
 * * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
