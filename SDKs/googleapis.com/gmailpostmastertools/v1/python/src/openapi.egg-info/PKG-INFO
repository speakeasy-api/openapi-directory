## Available Resources and Operations


### domains

* `gmailpostmastertools_domains_list` - Lists the domains that have been registered by the client. The order of domains in the response is unspecified and non-deterministic. Newly created domains will not necessarily be added to the end of this list.
* `gmailpostmastertools_domains_traffic_stats_get` - Get traffic statistics for a domain on a specific date. Returns PERMISSION_DENIED if user does not have permission to access TrafficStats for the domain.
* `gmailpostmastertools_domains_traffic_stats_list` - List traffic statistics for all available days. Returns PERMISSION_DENIED if user does not have permission to access TrafficStats for the domain.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
