type GetPromotionsQueryParams struct {
	// Specifies the maximum number of promotions returned on a page from the result set. Default: 200 Maximum: 200
	Limit *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=limit"`

	// Specifies the number of promotions to skip in the result set before returning the first promotion in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0
	Offset *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=offset"`
	// Specifies the promotion state by which you want to filter the results. The response contains only those promotions that match the state you specify. Valid values: DRAFT SCHEDULED RUNNING PAUSED ENDEDMaximum number of input values: 1
	PromotionStatus *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=promotion_status"`
	// Filters the returned promotions based on their campaign promotion type. Specify one of the following values to indicate the promotion type you want returned: CODED_COUPON &ndash; A coupon code promotion set with createItemPromotion.

	PromotionType *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=promotion_type"`
	// A string consisting of one or more keywords. eBay filters the response by returning only the promotions that contain the supplied keywords in the promotion title. Example: &quot;iPhone&quot; or &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; Commas that separate keywords are ignored. For example, a keyword string of &quot;iPhone, iPad&quot; equals &quot;iPhone iPad&quot;, and each results in a response that contains promotions with both &quot;iPhone&quot; and &quot;iPad&quot; in the title.
	Q *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=q"`
	// Specifies the order for how to sort the response. If you precede the supplied value with a dash, the response is sorted in reverse order. Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort=END_DATE &nbsp; Sorts the promotions in the response by their end dates in ascending order &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort=-PROMOTION_NAME &nbsp; Sorts the promotions by their promotion name in descending alphabetical order (Z-Az-a) Valid values: START_DATE END_DATE PROMOTION_NAME For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/marketing/types/csb:SortField
