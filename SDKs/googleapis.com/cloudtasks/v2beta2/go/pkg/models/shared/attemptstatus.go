	// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
	ResponseStatus *Status `json:"responseStatus,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The time that this attempt response was received. `response_time` will be truncated to the nearest microsecond.
	ResponseTime *string `json:"responseTime,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The time that this attempt was scheduled. `schedule_time` will be truncated to the nearest microsecond.
