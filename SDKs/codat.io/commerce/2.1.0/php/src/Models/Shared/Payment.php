/**
 * Payment - Payments contain details of all payments made by customers to a company, including: amounts, currency used, payment method, payment provider, and payment status.
 * 
 * 
 * Refunds are recorded as separate, negative payments. Note that a refund can only occur in relation to a payment that has been completed (i.e. has a status of `Paid`). When a customer cancels an order _before_ a payment has been completed, the payment shows as `Cancelled`.
 * 
 * You can use data from the Payments endpoints to calculate key metrics, such as gross sales and monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
 * 
 * Explore our [data coverage](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=commerce-payments) for this data type.
