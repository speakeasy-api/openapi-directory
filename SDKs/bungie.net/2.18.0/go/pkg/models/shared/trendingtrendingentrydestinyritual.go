// TrendingTrendingEntryDestinyRitualEventContent - Represents localized, extended content related to Milestones. This is intentionally returned by a separate endpoint and not with Character-level Milestone data because we do not put localized data into standard Destiny responses, both for brevity of response and for caching purposes. If you really need this data, hit the Milestone Content endpoint.

	// The "About this Milestone" text from the Firehose.
	About *string
	// If DPS has defined items related to this Milestone, they can categorize those items in the Firehose. That data will then be returned as item categories here.

	// The Current Status of the Milestone, as driven by the Firehose.
	Status *string
	// A list of tips, provided by the Firehose.

// TrendingTrendingEntryDestinyRitualMilestoneDetails - Information about milestones, presented in a character state-agnostic manner. Combine this data with DestinyMilestoneDefinition to get a full picture of the milestone, which is basically a checklist of things to do in the game. Think of this as GetPublicAdvisors 3.0, for those who used the Destiny 1 API.
