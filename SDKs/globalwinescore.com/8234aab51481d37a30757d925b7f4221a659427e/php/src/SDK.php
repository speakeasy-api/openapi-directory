/**
 * SDK - 
 * 
 * 
 * The GlobalWineScore API is designed as a RESTful API, providing several resources and methods depending on your usage plan.
 * 
 * For further information please refer to <a href="https://www.globalwinescore.com/plans" target="_blank">our plans</a>.
 * 
 * # Authentication
 * The API uses token-based authentication.
 * In order to authenticate your requests, you need to include a specific header in each of your requests:
 * 
 * ```
 * Authorization: Token {YOUR-API-TOKEN}
 * ```
 * The word <b>Token</b> must be written. Your requests must also use the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.
 * 
 * If you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/).
 * 
 * Your personal token can be found under the <a href="https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/" target="_blank">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website
 * 
 * # Format
 * The API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.
 * 
 * - JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`
 * - XML: `Accept: application/xml`
 * # Rate limiting
 * For API requests, the rate limit allows for up to 10 requests per minute.
 * 
 * # Error handling
 * 
 * Whether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.
 * 
 * When a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.
 * 
 * For example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:
 * 
 * `{"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."}`
 * 
 * Found a bug ? send us an email at <a href="mailto:api@globalwinescore.com">api@globalwinescore.com</a>
 * 
 * # Ordering
 * 
 * At the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use "-"
 * to sort in descending order.
 * 
 * # Continuous synchronization
 * 
 * If you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)
 * 
 * # Quick search interface
 * If you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href="https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/" target="_blank">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>
 * 
 * You need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !
 * 
 * # Resources
 * 
 * The details about available endpoints can be found below.
 * You can click on each endpoint to find information about their parameters.
