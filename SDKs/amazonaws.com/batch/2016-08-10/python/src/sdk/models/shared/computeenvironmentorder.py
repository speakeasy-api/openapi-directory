For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the <code>VALID</code> state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (<code>EC2</code> or <code>SPOT</code>) or Fargate (<code>FARGATE</code> or <code>FARGATE_SPOT</code>); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.</p> <note> <p>All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.</p> </note>"""
