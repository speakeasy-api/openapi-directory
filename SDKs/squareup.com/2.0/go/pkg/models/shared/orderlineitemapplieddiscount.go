// OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount - Represents an applied portion of a discount to a line item in an order.
//
// Order scoped discounts have automatically applied discounts present for each line item.
// Line-item scoped discounts must have applied discounts added manually for any applicable line
// items. The corresponding applied money is automatically computed based on participating
// line items.
type OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount struct {
	// Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.
	// Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are
	// considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the
	// sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See
	// [Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)
	// for more information.
	AppliedMoney *Money `json:"applied_money,omitempty"`
	// The `uid` of the discount that the applied discount represents. It must
	// reference a discount present in the `order.discounts` field.
	//
	// This field is immutable. To change which discounts apply to a line item,
	// you must delete the discount and re-add it as a new `OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount`.
	DiscountUID string `json:"discount_uid"`
	// A unique ID that identifies the applied discount only within this order.
	UID *string `json:"uid,omitempty"`
