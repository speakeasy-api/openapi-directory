/**
 * PivotGroupRule - An optional setting on a PivotGroup that defines buckets for the values in the source data column rather than breaking out each individual value. Only one PivotGroup with a group rule may be added for each column in the source data, though on any given column you may add both a PivotGroup that has a rule and a PivotGroup that does not.

    /**
     * Allows you to organize the date-time values in a source data column into buckets based on selected parts of their date or time values. For example, consider a pivot table showing sales transactions by date: +----------+--------------+ | Date | SUM of Sales | +----------+--------------+ | 1/1/2017 | $621.14 | | 2/3/2017 | $708.84 | | 5/8/2017 | $326.84 | ... +----------+--------------+ Applying a date-time group rule with a DateTimeRuleType of YEAR_MONTH results in the following pivot table. +--------------+--------------+ | Grouped Date | SUM of Sales | +--------------+--------------+ | 2017-Jan | $53,731.78 | | 2017-Feb | $83,475.32 | | 2017-Mar | $94,385.05 | ... +--------------+--------------+

Only HistogramRule.interval is required, though if HistogramRule.start and HistogramRule.end are both provided, HistogramRule.start must be less than HistogramRule.end.

Note that a similar effect could be achieved by adding a time zone column to the source data and adjusting the pivot table. +-----------+-------------------+ | Time Zone | SUM of Population | +-----------+-------------------+ | Central | 106.3 | | Eastern | 151.9 | | Mountain | 17.4 | ... +-----------+-------------------+
