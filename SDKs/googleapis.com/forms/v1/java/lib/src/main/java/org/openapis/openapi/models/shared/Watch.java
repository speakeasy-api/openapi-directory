/**
 * Watch - A watch for events for a form. When the designated event happens, a notification will be published to the specified target. The notification's attributes will include a `formId` key that has the ID of the watched form and an `eventType` key that has the string of the type. Messages are sent with at-least-once delivery and are only dropped in extraordinary circumstances. Typically all notifications should be reliably delivered within a few seconds; however, in some situations notifications may be delayed. A watch expires seven days after it is created unless it is renewed with watches.renew
