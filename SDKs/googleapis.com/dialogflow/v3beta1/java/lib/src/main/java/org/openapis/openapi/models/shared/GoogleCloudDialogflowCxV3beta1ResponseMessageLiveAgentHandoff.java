 * GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3beta1ResponseMessageLiveAgentHandoff - Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.

You may set this, for example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation. * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.
