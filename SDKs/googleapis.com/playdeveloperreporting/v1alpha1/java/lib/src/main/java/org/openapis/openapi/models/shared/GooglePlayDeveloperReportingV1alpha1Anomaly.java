/**
 * GooglePlayDeveloperReportingV1alpha1Anomaly - Represents an anomaly detected in a dataset. Our anomaly detection systems flag datapoints in a time series that fall outside of and expected range derived from historical data. Although those expected ranges have an upper and a lower bound, we only flag anomalies when the data has become unexpectedly _worse_, which usually corresponds to the case where the metric crosses the upper bound. Multiple contiguous datapoints in a timeline outside of the expected range will be grouped into a single anomaly. Therefore, an anomaly represents effectively a segment of a metric's timeline. The information stored in the `timeline_spec`, `dimensions` and `metric` can be used to fetch a full timeline with extended ragne for context. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app.

    /**
     * Specification of the time-related aggregation parameters of a timeline. Timelines have an aggregation period (`DAILY`, `HOURLY`, etc) which defines how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC' or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of the day. Not all metric sets support all timezones, so make sure to check which timezones are supported by the metric set you want to query.
