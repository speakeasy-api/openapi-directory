### SDK SDK

* `generateDataSet` - Given a data set type and data set publication date, asynchronously publishes the requested data set to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data is available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests with notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma-separated values (CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD.csv. If a file with the same name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the original file will be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.
* `startSupportDataExport` - Given a data set type and a from date, asynchronously publishes the requested customer support data to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data is available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests with notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma-separated values (CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH-mm-ss'Z'.csv. If a file with the same name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the original file will be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
