 * The status of the store. Possible values are:
 * 
 * 
 * - **active**: This value is assigned automatically when a store is created. 
 * - **inactive**: The maximum [transaction limits and number of Store-and-Forward transactions](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/determine-account-structure/configure-features#payment-features) for the store are set to 0. This blocks new transactions, but captures are still possible.
 * - **closed**: The terminals of the store are reassigned to the merchant inventory, so they can't process payments.
 * 
 * You can change the status from **active** to **inactive**, and from **inactive** to **active** or **closed**. 
 * Once **closed**, a store can't be reopened.
