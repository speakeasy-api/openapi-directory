type DocumentationRule struct {
	// Deprecation description of the selected element(s). It can be provided if an element is marked as `deprecated`.
	DeprecationDescription *string `json:"deprecationDescription,omitempty"`
	// Description of the selected proto element (e.g. a message, a method, a 'service' definition, or a field). Defaults to leading & trailing comments taken from the proto source definition of the proto element.
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// The selector is a comma-separated list of patterns for any element such as a method, a field, an enum value. Each pattern is a qualified name of the element which may end in "*", indicating a wildcard. Wildcards are only allowed at the end and for a whole component of the qualified name, i.e. "foo.*" is ok, but not "foo.b*" or "foo.*.bar". A wildcard will match one or more components. To specify a default for all applicable elements, the whole pattern "*" is used.
	Selector *string `json:"selector,omitempty"`
