/**
 * ProxyModifyRatePlanChargeRatingGroupEnum - Specifies a rating group based on which usage records are rated. 
 * 
 * * `ByBillingPeriod` (default) - The rating is based on all the usages in a billing period. 
 * * `ByUsageStartDate` - The rating is based on all the usages on the same usage start date.
 * * `ByUsageRecord` - The rating is based on each usage record.
 * * `ByUsageUpload` - The rating is based on all the usages in a uploaded usage file (`.xls` or `.csv`). If you import a mass usage in a single upload, which contains multiple usage files in `.xls` or `.csv` format, usage records are grouped for each usage file.
 * * `ByGroupId` - The rating is based on all the usages in the same custom group. 
 * 
 * 
 * **Note:** 
 * - The `ByBillingPeriod` value can be applied for all charge models. 
 * - The `ByUsageStartDate`, `ByUsageRecord`, and `ByUsageUpload` values can only be applied for per unit, volume pricing, and tiered pricing charge models. 
 * - The `ByGroupId` value is only available if you have the Active Rating feature enabled.
 * - Use this field only for Usage charges. One-Time Charges and Recurring Charges return `NULL`.
 * 
 * 
 * See [Usage Rating by Group](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/Usage_Rating_by_Group) for more information.
