/**
 * AccountGateResult - <p>Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with a stack set operation in an account and Region.</p> <p>For each account and Region, CloudFormation lets you specify a Lambda function that encapsulates any requirements that must be met before CloudFormation can proceed with a stack set operation in that account and Region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a stack set operation is requested for that account and Region; if the function returns <code>FAILED</code>, CloudFormation cancels the operation in that account and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that account and Region to <code>FAILED</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-account-gating.html">Configuring a target account gate</a>.</p>
