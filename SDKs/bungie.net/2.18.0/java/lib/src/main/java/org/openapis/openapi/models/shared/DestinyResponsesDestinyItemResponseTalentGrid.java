     * Well, we're here in Destiny 2, and Talent Grids are unfortunately still around.
     * The good news is that they're pretty much only being used for certain base information on items and for Builds/Subclasses. The bad news is that they still suck. If you really want this information, grab this component.
     * An important note is that talent grids are defined as such:
     * A Grid has 1:M Nodes, which has 1:M Steps.
     * Any given node can only have a single step active at one time, which represents the actual visual contents and effects of the Node (for instance, if you see a "Super Cool Bonus" node, the actual icon and text for the node is coming from the current Step of that node).
     * Nodes can be grouped into exclusivity sets *and* as of D2, exclusivity groups (which are collections of exclusivity sets that affect each other).
     * See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for more information. Brace yourself, the water's cold out there in the deep end.
