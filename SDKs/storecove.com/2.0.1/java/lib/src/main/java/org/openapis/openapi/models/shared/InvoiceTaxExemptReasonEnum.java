 * InvoiceTaxExemptReasonEnum - DEPRECATED. Use Tax/category and specify this per invoice line. If you do specify this field, it will be applied to all invoice lines and it is an error to specify a Tax/category at the invoice line level. This field holds the reason no tax is present in the invoice. Note that this is an invoice level field and you cannot specify it per invoice line. This field is mandatory unless tax is present in the invoice.
