The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Metadata that fails to meet these requirements are rejected Note: This field is equivalent to the `annotations` field in the v1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
