This message can define specific values and subtrees of the Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - "projects/", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123" - "folders/", e.g. "folders/1234" - "organizations/", e.g. "organizations/1234" The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used.
