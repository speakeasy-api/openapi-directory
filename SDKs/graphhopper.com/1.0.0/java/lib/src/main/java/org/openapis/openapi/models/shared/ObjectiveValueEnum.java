/**
 * ObjectiveValueEnum - The value of the objective function.
 * The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time
 * your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.
 * The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,
 * i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.
 * Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in
 * scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.
 * The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.
