## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `DescribeStream` - <p>Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards, and its corresponding DynamoDB table.</p> <note> <p>You can call <code>DescribeStream</code> at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.</p> </note> <p>Each shard in the stream has a <code>SequenceNumberRange</code> associated with it. If the <code>SequenceNumberRange</code> has a <code>StartingSequenceNumber</code> but no <code>EndingSequenceNumber</code>, then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both <code>StartingSequenceNumber</code> and <code>EndingSequenceNumber</code> are present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.</p>
* `GetRecords` - <p>Retrieves the stream records from a given shard.</p> <p>Specify a shard iterator using the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading stream records sequentially. If there are no stream records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, <code>GetRecords</code> returns an empty list. Note that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains stream records.</p> <note> <p> <code>GetRecords</code> can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data or 1000 stream records, whichever comes first.</p> </note>
* `GetShardIterator` - <p>Returns a shard iterator. A shard iterator provides information about how to retrieve the stream records from within a shard. Use the shard iterator in a subsequent <code>GetRecords</code> request to read the stream records from the shard.</p> <note> <p>A shard iterator expires 15 minutes after it is returned to the requester.</p> </note>
* `ListStreams` - <p>Returns an array of stream ARNs associated with the current account and endpoint. If the <code>TableName</code> parameter is present, then <code>ListStreams</code> will return only the streams ARNs for that table.</p> <note> <p>You can call <code>ListStreams</code> at a maximum rate of 5 times per second.</p> </note>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
