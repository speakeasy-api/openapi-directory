// APISpecInput - An ApiSpec describes a version of an API in a structured way. ApiSpecs provide formal descriptions that consumers can use to use a version. ApiSpec resources are intended to be fully-resolved descriptions of an ApiVersion. When specs consist of multiple files, these should be bundled together (e.g. in a zip archive) and stored as a unit. Multiple specs can exist to provide representations in different API description formats. Synchronization of these representations would be provided by tooling and background services.
type APISpecInput struct {
	// Annotations attach non-identifying metadata to resources. Annotation keys and values are less restricted than those of labels, but should be generally used for small values of broad interest. Larger, topic- specific metadata should be stored in Artifacts.
	Annotations map[string]string `json:"annotations,omitempty"`
	// Input only. The contents of the spec. Provided by API callers when specs are created or updated. To access the contents of a spec, use GetApiSpecContents.
	Contents *string `json:"contents,omitempty"`
	// A detailed description.
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// A possibly-hierarchical name used to refer to the spec from other specs.
	Filename *string `json:"filename,omitempty"`
	// Labels attach identifying metadata to resources. Identifying metadata can be used to filter list operations. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one resource (System labels are excluded). See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with "apigeeregistry.googleapis.com/" and cannot be changed.

Possible values include "application/vnd.apigee.proto", "application/vnd.apigee.openapi", and "application/vnd.apigee.graphql", with possible suffixes representing compression types. These hypothetical names are defined in the vendor tree defined in RFC6838 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) and are not final. Content types can specify compression. Currently only GZip compression is supported (indicated with "+gzip").
