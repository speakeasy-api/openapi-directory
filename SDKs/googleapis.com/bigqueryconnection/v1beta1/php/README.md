### projects

* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsCreate` - Creates a new connection.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsDelete` - Deletes connection and associated credential.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsGet` - Returns specified connection.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsGetIamPolicy` - Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsList` - Returns a list of connections in the given project.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsSetIamPolicy` - Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsTestIamPermissions` - Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.
* `bigqueryconnectionProjectsLocationsConnectionsUpdateCredential` - Sets the credential for the specified connection.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
