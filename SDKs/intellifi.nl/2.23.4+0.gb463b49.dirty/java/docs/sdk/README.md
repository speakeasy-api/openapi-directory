## Overview

This document describes the [Intellifi Brain](https://intellifi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000685454)
Web API specification using the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

The Brain Web API is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with the
[Intellifi devices](https://intellifi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000685434) and
services in a powerful and simple way. Our end-to-end solution allows you to
localize your items/assets based on technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth.

# Try it out!

The API can be tried out and tested using the ['api-doc/tryitout' endpoint on this site](./tryitout/).
This UI allows anyone to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.
It’s automatically generated from this Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

# Authentication

Applications are required to provide some form of authentication to the API
for every secured endpoint. The Brain offers two forms of authentication.

- API key (Via an HTTP request header or URL parameter)
- Session cookie
