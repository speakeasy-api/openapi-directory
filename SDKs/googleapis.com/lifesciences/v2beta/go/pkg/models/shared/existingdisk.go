If `disk` does not contain slashes, the Cloud Life Sciences API assumes that the disk is a zonal disk and a URL will be generated of the form `zones//disks/`, where `` is the zone in which the instance is allocated. The disk must be ext4 formatted. If all `Mount` references to this disk have the `read_only` flag set to true, the disk will be attached in `read-only` mode and can be shared with other instances. Otherwise, the disk will be available for writing but cannot be shared.
