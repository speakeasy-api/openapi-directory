     * Please note that Server names must be unique per Project and valid hostnames as per RFC 1123 (i.e. may only contain letters, digits, periods, and dashes).
     * 
     * For `server_type` you can either use the ID as listed in `/server_types` or its name.
     * 
     * For `image` you can either use the ID as listed in `/images` or its name.
     * 
     * If you want to create the Server in a Location, you must set `location` to the ID or name as listed in `/locations`. This is the recommended way. You can be even more specific by setting `datacenter` to the ID or name as listed in `/datacenters`. However we only recommend this if you want to assign a specific Primary IP to the Server which is located in the specified Datacenter.
     * 
     * Some properties like `start_after_create` or `automount` will trigger Actions after the Server is created. Those Actions are listed in the `next_actions` field in the response.
     * 
     * For accessing your Server we strongly recommend to use SSH keys by passing the respective key IDs in `ssh_keys`. If you do not specify any `ssh_keys` we will generate a root password for you and return it in the response.
     * 
     * Please note that provided user-data is stored in our systems. While we take measures to protect it we highly recommend that you don\u2019t use it to store passwords or other sensitive information.
