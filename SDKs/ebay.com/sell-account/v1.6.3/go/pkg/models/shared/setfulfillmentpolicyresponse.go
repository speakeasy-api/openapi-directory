// SetFulfillmentPolicyResponse - Complex type that that gets populated with a response containing a fulfillment policy.
type SetFulfillmentPolicyResponse struct {
	// The CategoryTypeEnum value to which this policy applies. This container is used to discern accounts that sell motor vehicles from those that do not. Restriction: Currently, each policy can be set to only one categoryTypes value at a time.
	CategoryTypes []CategoryType `json:"categoryTypes,omitempty"`
	// An optional seller-defined description of the fulfillment policy for internal use (this value is not displayed to end users). Max length: 250
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// If set to true, the seller offers freight shipping. Freight shipping can be used for large items over 150 lbs.
	FreightShipping *bool `json:"freightShipping,omitempty"`
	// A unique eBay-assigned ID for a fulfillment policy. This ID is generated when the policy is created.
	FulfillmentPolicyID *string `json:"fulfillmentPolicyId,omitempty"`
	// If set to true, the seller has opted-in to the Global Shipping Program and eBay automatically sets the international shipping service options to International Priority Shipping. If the value of globalShipping is false, the seller is responsible for specifying one or more international shipping service options if they want to ship internationally.
	GlobalShipping *bool `json:"globalShipping,omitempty"`
	// A complex type that specifies a period of time using a specified time-measurement unit.
	HandlingTime *TimeDuration `json:"handlingTime,omitempty"`
	// If set to true, no shipping is offered by this policy and the seller offers only local pickup of the item (normally from a non-business location). This option is most often used for customer-to-customer sales and if set, costType should be set to NOT_SPECIFIED.
	LocalPickup *bool `json:"localPickup,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the eBay marketplace to which this fulfillment policy applies. If this value is not specified, value defaults to the seller's eBay registration site. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/account/types/ba:MarketplaceIdEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
	MarketplaceID *string `json:"marketplaceId,omitempty"`
	// A user-defined name for this fulfillment policy. Names must be unique for policies assigned to the same marketplace. Max length: 64
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// If set to true, the seller offers the &quot;Click and Collect&quot; option. Currently, &quot;Click and Collect&quot; is available only to large retail merchants the eBay AU and UK marketplaces.
	PickupDropOff *bool `json:"pickupDropOff,omitempty"`
	// This complex type contains the regionIncluded and regionExcluded fields, which indicate the areas to where the seller does and doesn't ship. Normally a seller ships to as many areas as possible using both DOMESTIC and INTERNATIONAL shipping options, and they don't have a need to exclude any regions from their ship-to locations. Here, there's no reason to set regionExcluded fields. However, it makes sense to set the regionExcluded field when a seller wants to exclude a small area that's within a larger area they service. For example, suppose a seller indicates they ship 'Worldwide', but for some reason must exclude a specific country, or world region. Note: Configuring the shipToLocations is tricky because the regionIncluded and regionExcluded fields are valid in different parts of the schema and their allowable settings vary upon the context. For details on setting these fields, see .
	ShipToLocations *RegionSet `json:"shipToLocations,omitempty"`
	// A list that defines the seller's shipping configurations for DOMESTIC and INTERNATIONAL order shipments. The list has a single element if the seller ships to only domestic locations. If the seller also ships internationally, a second element defines their international shipping options. Shipping options configure the high-level shipping settings that apply to orders, such as flat-rate or calculated shipping, and any rate tables the seller wants to associate with the shipping services. Each shippingOption element has a shippingServices container that defines the list of shipping services (domestic or international) offered with this fulfillment policy.
	ShippingOptions []ShippingOption `json:"shippingOptions,omitempty"`
	// A list of warnings that were generated during the processing of the request. This field normally returns empty, which indicates the request did not generate any warnings.
	Warnings []Error `json:"warnings,omitempty"`
}
