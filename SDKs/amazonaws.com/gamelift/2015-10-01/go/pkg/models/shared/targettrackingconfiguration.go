// TargetTrackingConfiguration - <p> <b>This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and game server groups.</b> </p> <p>Settings for a target-based scaling policy as part of a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy.html">GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy</a> . These settings are used to create a target-based policy that tracks the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ metric <code>"PercentUtilizedGameServers"</code> and specifies a target value for the metric. As player usage changes, the policy triggers to adjust the game server group capacity so that the metric returns to the target value. </p>
