	Amount *Amount `json:"amount,omitempty"`
	// This field contains additional information provided by the bank and passed on by the payment processor; e.g., the manner in which the transaction will appear on the seller's bank statement. The field is returned only when provided by the bank and processor.
	BankReference *string `json:"bankReference,omitempty"`
	// This timestamp indicates the date/time when eBay last attempted to process a seller payout but it failed. This field is only returned if a seller payout fails, and the payoutStatus value shows RETRYABLE_FAILED or TERMINAL_FAILED. A seller can filter on the lastAttemptedPayoutDate in a getPayouts request.
	LastAttemptedPayoutDate *string `json:"lastAttemptedPayoutDate,omitempty"`
	// This timestamp indicates when the seller payout began processing. The following format is used: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. For example, 2015-08-04T19:09:02.768Z. This field is still returned even if the payout was pending but failed (payoutStatus value shows RETRYABLE_FAILED or TERMINAL_FAILED).
	PayoutDate *string `json:"payoutDate,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier of the seller payout. This identifier is generated once eBay begins processing the payout to the seller's bank account.

	PayoutStatus *string `json:"payoutStatus,omitempty"`
	// This field provides more details about the current status of payout. The description returned here will correspond with enumeration value returned in the payoutStatus field.

	PayoutStatusDescription *string `json:"payoutStatusDescription,omitempty"`
	// This integer value indicates the number of monetary transactions (all orders, refunds, and credits, etc.) that have occurred with the corresponding payout. Its value should always be at least 1, since there is at least one order per seller payout.
	TransactionCount *int `json:"transactionCount,omitempty"`
