 * Represents a Target HTTP Proxy resource. Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTP Proxy resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/targetHttpProxies) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionTargetHttpProxies) A target HTTP proxy is a component of GCP HTTP load balancers. * targetHttpProxies are used by external HTTP load balancers and Traffic Director. * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by internal HTTP load balancers. Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map. For more information, read Using Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.
