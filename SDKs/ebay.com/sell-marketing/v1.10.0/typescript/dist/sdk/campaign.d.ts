     * createCampaign - This method creates a Promoted Listings ad campaign. A Promoted Listings campaign is the structure into which you place the ads for the listings you want to promote. Identify the items you want to place into a campaign either by &quot;key&quot; or by &quot;rule&quot; as follows: Rules-based campaigns &ndash; A rules-based campaign adds items to the campaign according to the criteria you specify in your call to createCampaign. Key-based campaigns &ndash; Add items to an existing campaign using either listing ID values or Inventory Reference values: Add listingId values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByListingID or bulkCreateAdsByListingId. Add inventoryReference values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByInventoryReference or bulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference. Note: No matter how you add items to a Promoted Listings campaign, each campaign can contain ads for a maximum of 50,000 items. If a rules-based campaign identifies more than 50,000 items, ads are created for only the first 50,000 items identified by the specified criteria, and ads are not created for the remaining items. Creating a campaign To create a basic campaign, supply: The user-defined campaign name The start date (and optionally the end date) of the campaign The eBay marketplace on which the campaign is hosted Details on the campaign funding model The campaign funding model specifies how the Promoted Listings fee is calculated. Currently, the only supported funding model is COST_PER_SALE. For complete information on how the fee is calculated and when it applies, see Promoted Listings fees. If you populate the campaignCriterion object in your createCampaign request, campaign &quot;ads&quot; are created by &quot;rule&quot; for the listings that meet the criteria you specify, and these ads are associated with the newly created campaign. For details on creating Promoted Listings campaigns and how to select the items to be included in your campaigns, see Creating a Promoted Listings campaign. For recommendations on which listings are prime for a Promoted Listings ad campaign and to get guidance on how to set the bidPercentage field, see Using the Recommendation API to help configure campaigns. Tip: See Promoted Listings requirements and restrictions for the details on the marketplaces that support Promoted Listings via the API.
