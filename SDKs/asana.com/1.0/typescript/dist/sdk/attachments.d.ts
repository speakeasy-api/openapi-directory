     * Upload an attachment.
     *
     * This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact
     * record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:
     *
     * - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or
     * - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach
     * files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API
     *
     * The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.
     *
     * This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.
     *
     * Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
     * terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
     * [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.
