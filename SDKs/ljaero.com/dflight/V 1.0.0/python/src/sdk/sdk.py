    - Providing a latitude/longitude point and distance around that point
    - Providing a GeoJSON LineString defining your route
    - Providing an arbitrary GeoJSON Polygon defining your area of interest

    All published/active TFRs in specified area will be included in the response. Check the startDateTime and endDateTime properties to determine whether or not the restriction is applicable during your planned time of operation. In case of a TFR in your area of intended operation, you might still be able to fly by obtaining a via waiver through the [Special Governmental Interest (SGI) process](https://www.faa.gov/uas/advanced_operations/emergency_situations).
