   * A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear). The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.
