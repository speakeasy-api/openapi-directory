This results in a new revision of the form that incorporates both the changes in the request and the intervening changes, with the server resolving conflicting changes. The target revision ID may only be used to write to recent versions of a form. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 (Bad Request Error). The request may be retried after reading the latest version of the form. In most cases a target revision ID remains valid for several minutes after it is read, but for frequently-edited forms this window may be shorter.
