        * If the target date is later than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date.
    
        * If the target date is earlier than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memeo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.
