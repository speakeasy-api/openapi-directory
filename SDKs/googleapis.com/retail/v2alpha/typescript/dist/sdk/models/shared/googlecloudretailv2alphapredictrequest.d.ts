     * Filter for restricting prediction results with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values by a space. `-"tagA"` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT "tagA"`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1,000 characters. Note: "Recently viewed" models don't support tag filtering at the moment. * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-"promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks all prediction results, the API will return *no* results. If instead you want empty result sets to return generic (unfiltered) popular products, set `strictFiltering` to False in `PredictRequest.params`. Note that the API will never return items with storageStatus of "EXPIRED" or "DELETED" regardless of filter choices. If `filterSyntaxV2` is set to true under the `params` field, then attribute-based expressions are expected instead of the above described tag-based syntax. Examples: * (colors: ANY("Red", "Blue")) AND NOT (categories: ANY("Phones")) * (availability: ANY("IN_STOCK")) AND (colors: ANY("Red") OR categories: ANY("Phones")) For more information, see [Filter recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-recs).

Values can be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters. * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes.

If set to true, the associated product object will be returned in the `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction 'score' corresponding to each returned product will be set in the `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. The given 'score' indicates the probability of a product being clicked/purchased given the user's context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular products instead of empty if your filter blocks all prediction results. * `priceRerankLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {'no-price-reranking', 'low-price-reranking', 'medium-price-reranking', 'high-price-reranking'}. This gives request-level control and adjusts prediction results based on product price. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {'no-diversity', 'low-diversity', 'medium-diversity', 'high-diversity', 'auto-diversity'}. This gives request-level control and adjusts prediction results based on product category. * `filterSyntaxV2`: Boolean. False by default. If set to true, the `filter` field is interpreteted according to the new, attribute-based syntax.
