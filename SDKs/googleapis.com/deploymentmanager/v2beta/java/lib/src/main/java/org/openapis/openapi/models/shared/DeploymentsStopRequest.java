     * Specifies a fingerprint for `stop()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided in `stop()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that the deployment does not have conflicting requests (e.g. if someone attempts to make a new update request while another user attempts to stop an ongoing update request, this would prevent a collision). The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify a deployment. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request on the deployment.
