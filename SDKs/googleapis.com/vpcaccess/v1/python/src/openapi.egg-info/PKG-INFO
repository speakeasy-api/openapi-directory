## Available Resources and Operations


### projects

* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_connectors_create` - Creates a Serverless VPC Access connector, returns an operation.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_connectors_delete` - Deletes a Serverless VPC Access connector. Returns NOT_FOUND if the resource does not exist.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_connectors_list` - Lists Serverless VPC Access connectors.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_connectors_patch` - Updates a Serverless VPC Access connector, returns an operation.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_list` - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_operations_get` - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
* `vpcaccess_projects_locations_operations_list` - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
