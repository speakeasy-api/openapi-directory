## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `get_deployments` - Use to get the active deployments from a device.
* `get_device_registration` - Use to check if a device is registered with SageMaker Edge Manager.
* `send_heartbeat` - Use to get the current status of devices registered on SageMaker Edge Manager.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
