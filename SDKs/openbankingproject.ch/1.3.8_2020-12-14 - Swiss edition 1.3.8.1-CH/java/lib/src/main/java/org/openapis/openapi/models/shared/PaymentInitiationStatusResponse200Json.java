     * The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table:
     * - 'ACCC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
     *   Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.
     * - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' -

     * - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
     *   Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
     * - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -

     * - 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -
     *   A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.
