### Composer

To install the SDK first add the below to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"
    }

```

Then run the following command:

```bash
composer update
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `describeDimensionKeys` - <p>For a specific time period, retrieve the top <code>N</code> dimension keys for a metric. </p> <note> <p>Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.</p> </note>
* `getDimensionKeyDetails` - Get the attributes of the specified dimension group for a DB instance or data source. For example, if you specify a SQL ID, <code>GetDimensionKeyDetails</code> retrieves the full text of the dimension <code>db.sql.statement</code> associated with this ID. This operation is useful because <code>GetResourceMetrics</code> and <code>DescribeDimensionKeys</code> don't support retrieval of large SQL statement text.
* `getResourceMetadata` - Retrieve the metadata for different features. For example, the metadata might indicate that a feature is turned on or off on a specific DB instance. 
* `getResourceMetrics` - <p>Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources over a time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and dimensions, and provide aggregation and filtering criteria for each group.</p> <note> <p>Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.</p> </note>
* `listAvailableResourceDimensions` - Retrieve the dimensions that can be queried for each specified metric type on a specified DB instance.
* `listAvailableResourceMetrics` - Retrieve metrics of the specified types that can be queried for a specified DB instance.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
