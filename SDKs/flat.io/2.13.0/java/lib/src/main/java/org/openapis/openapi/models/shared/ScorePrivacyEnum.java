/**
 * ScorePrivacyEnum - The score main privacy mode.
 * 
 * - `public`: The score is public on the Internet. This one can be accessible at the url `https://flat.io/score/{score}` and can be modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
 * - `private`: The score is private and can be only accessed, modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
 * - `privateLink`: The score is private but can be accessed using a private link `htmlUrl` or the private key in the property `sharingKey`.
 * - `organizationPublic`: _Available only with [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu)._ The score is public in the organization: users of the same organization can access to this one. The score can be modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
 * 
 * The score can also be individually shared to a set of users or groups using the different collaborators API methods.
 * 
 * When a file is synchronized from an external source (e.g. Google Drive) and the sharing options are changed on the source, Flat will chose the best privacy mode for the file.
 * 
 * When using a [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) account, some of the modes may not be available if disabled by an administrator of the organization (e.g. by default the `public` mode is not available).
