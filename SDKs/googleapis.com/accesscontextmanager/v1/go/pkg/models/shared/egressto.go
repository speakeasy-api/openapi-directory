// EgressTo - Defines the conditions under which an EgressPolicy matches a request. Conditions are based on information about the ApiOperation intended to be performed on the `resources` specified. Note that if the destination of the request is also protected by a ServicePerimeter, then that ServicePerimeter must have an IngressPolicy which allows access in order for this request to succeed. The request must match `operations` AND `resources` fields in order to be allowed egress out of the perimeter.
type EgressTo struct {
	// A list of external resources that are allowed to be accessed. Only AWS and Azure resources are supported. For Amazon S3, the supported format is s3://BUCKET_NAME. For Azure Storage, the supported format is azure://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/CONTAINER_NAME. A request matches if it contains an external resource in this list (Example: s3://bucket/path). Currently '*' is not allowed.
	ExternalResources []string `json:"externalResources,omitempty"`
	// A list of ApiOperations allowed to be performed by the sources specified in the corresponding EgressFrom. A request matches if it uses an operation/service in this list.
	Operations []APIOperation `json:"operations,omitempty"`
	// A list of resources, currently only projects in the form `projects/`, that are allowed to be accessed by sources defined in the corresponding EgressFrom. A request matches if it contains a resource in this list. If `*` is specified for `resources`, then this EgressTo rule will authorize access to all resources outside the perimeter.
	Resources []string `json:"resources,omitempty"`
