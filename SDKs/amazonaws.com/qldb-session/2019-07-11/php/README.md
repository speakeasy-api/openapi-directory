### SDK SDK

* `sendCommand` - <p>Sends a command to an Amazon QLDB ledger.</p> <note> <p>Instead of interacting directly with this API, we recommend using the QLDB driver or the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on a ledger.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The driver provides a high-level abstraction layer above this <i>QLDB Session</i> data plane and manages <code>SendCommand</code> API calls for you. For information and a list of supported programming languages, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html">Getting started with the driver</a> in the <i>Amazon QLDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use the QLDB shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses the QLDB driver to interact with a ledger. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/data-shell.html">Accessing Amazon QLDB using the QLDB shell</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
