// PartitionQueryRequest - The request for Firestore.PartitionQuery.
type PartitionQueryRequest struct {
	// The maximum number of partitions to return in this call, subject to `partition_count`. For example, if `partition_count` = 10 and `page_size` = 8, the first call to PartitionQuery will return up to 8 partitions and a `next_page_token` if more results exist. A second call to PartitionQuery will return up to 2 partitions, to complete the total of 10 specified in `partition_count`.
	PageSize *int `json:"pageSize,omitempty"`
	// The `next_page_token` value returned from a previous call to PartitionQuery that may be used to get an additional set of results. There are no ordering guarantees between sets of results. Thus, using multiple sets of results will require merging the different result sets. For example, two subsequent calls using a page_token may return: * cursor B, cursor M, cursor Q * cursor A, cursor U, cursor W To obtain a complete result set ordered with respect to the results of the query supplied to PartitionQuery, the results sets should be merged: cursor A, cursor B, cursor M, cursor Q, cursor U, cursor W
	PageToken *string `json:"pageToken,omitempty"`
	// The desired maximum number of partition points. The partitions may be returned across multiple pages of results. The number must be positive. The actual number of partitions returned may be fewer. For example, this may be set to one fewer than the number of parallel queries to be run, or in running a data pipeline job, one fewer than the number of workers or compute instances available.
	PartitionCount *string `json:"partitionCount,omitempty"`
	// Reads documents as they were at the given time. This may not be older than 270 seconds.
	ReadTime *string `json:"readTime,omitempty"`
	// A Firestore query.
	StructuredQuery *StructuredQuery `json:"structuredQuery,omitempty"`
