	// The value of the <strong>limit</strong> parameter submitted in the request, which is the maximum number of tasks to return per page, from the result set. A result set is the complete set of tasks returned by the method. <p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> Even though this parameter is not required to be submitted in the request, the parameter defaults to 10 if omitted.</span></p><p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> If this is the last or only page of the result set, the page may contain fewer tasks than the limit value. To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total number of tasks matching input criteria) by this limit value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the <strong>total</strong> value was <code>120</code> (120 total tasks) and the <strong>limit</strong> value was <code>50</code> (show 50 tasks per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate <strong>getCustomerServiceMetricTasks</strong> calls to view all tasks matching the input criteria.</span></p>
