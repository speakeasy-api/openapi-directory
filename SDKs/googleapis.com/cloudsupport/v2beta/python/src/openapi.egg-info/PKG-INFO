## Available Resources and Operations


### case_classifications

* `cloudsupport_case_classifications_search` - Retrieve valid classifications to be used when creating a support case. The classications are hierarchical, with each classification containing all levels of the hierarchy, separated by " > ". For example "Technical Issue > Compute > Compute Engine".

### cases

* `cloudsupport_cases_search` - Search cases using the specified query.

### media

* `cloudsupport_media_download` - Download a file attachment on a case. Note: HTTP requests must append "?alt=media" to the URL.
* `cloudsupport_media_upload` - Create a file attachment on a case or Cloud resource. The attachment object must have the following fields set: filename.

### projects

* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_attachments_list` - Retrieve all attachments associated with a support case.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_close` - Close the specified case.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_comments_create` - Add a new comment to the specified Case. The comment object must have the following fields set: body.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_comments_list` - Retrieve all Comments associated with the Case object.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_create` - Create a new case and associate it with the given Cloud resource. The case object must have the following fields set: display_name, description, classification, and severity.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_escalate` - Escalate a case. Escalating a case will initiate the Cloud Support escalation management process. This operation is only available to certain Customer Care tiers. Go to https://cloud.google.com/support and look for 'Technical support escalations' in the feature list to find out which tiers are able to perform escalations.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_get` - Retrieve the specified case.
* `cloudsupport_projects_cases_list` - Retrieve all cases under the specified parent. Note: Listing cases under an Organization returns only the cases directly parented by that organization. To retrieve all cases under an organization, including cases parented by projects under that organization, use `cases.search`.
* `cloudsupport_projects_update_cases` - Update the specified case. Only a subset of fields can be updated.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
