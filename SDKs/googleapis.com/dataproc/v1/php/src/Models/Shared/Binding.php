     * Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. members can have the following values: allUsers: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. allAuthenticatedUsers: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. user:{emailid}: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@example.com . serviceAccount:{emailid}: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com. serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]: An identifier for a Kubernetes service account (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]. group:{emailid}: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com. domain:{domain}: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com. deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to user:{emailid} and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to serviceAccount:{emailid} and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to group:{emailid} and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.
