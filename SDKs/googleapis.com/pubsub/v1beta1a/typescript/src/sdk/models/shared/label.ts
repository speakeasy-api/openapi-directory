   * The key of a label is a syntactically valid URL (as per RFC 1738) with the "scheme" and initial slashes omitted and with the additional restrictions noted below. Each key should be globally unique. The "host" portion is called the "namespace" and is not necessarily resolvable to a network endpoint. Instead, the namespace indicates what system or entity defines the semantics of the label. Namespaces do not restrict the set of objects to which a label may be associated. Keys are defined by the following grammar: key = hostname "/" kpath kpath = ksegment *[ "/" ksegment ] ksegment = alphadigit | *[ alphadigit | "-" | "_" | "." ] where "hostname" and "alphadigit" are defined as in RFC 1738. Example key: spanner.google.com/universe
