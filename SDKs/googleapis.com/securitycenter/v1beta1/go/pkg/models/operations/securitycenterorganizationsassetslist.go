	// Data format for response.

	Callback *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=callback"`
	// When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetResult's "state" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible "state" values when compare_duration is specified: * "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present before compare_duration, but present at read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state is "UNUSED", which indicates that the asset is present at read_time.
	CompareDuration *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=compareDuration"`
	// Optional. A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
	FieldMask *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=fieldMask"`
	// Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
	Fields *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=fields"`
	// Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
	Filter *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=filter"`
	// API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
	Key *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=key"`
	// OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
	OauthToken *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=oauth_token"`
	// Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent.
	OrderBy *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=orderBy"`
	// The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
	PageSize *int64 `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=pageSize"`
	// The value returned by the last `ListAssetsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListAssets` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
	PageToken *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=pageToken"`
	// Required. Name of the organization assets should belong to. Its format is "organizations/[organization_id]".
	Parent string `pathParam:"style=simple,explode=false,name=parent"`
	// Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
	PrettyPrint *bool `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=prettyPrint"`
	// Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
	QuotaUser *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=quotaUser"`
	// Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter is limited to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the API's version of NOW.
	ReadTime *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=readTime"`
	// Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. "media", "multipart").
	UploadType *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=uploadType"`
	// Upload protocol for media (e.g. "raw", "multipart").
	UploadProtocol *string `queryParam:"style=form,explode=true,name=upload_protocol"`
