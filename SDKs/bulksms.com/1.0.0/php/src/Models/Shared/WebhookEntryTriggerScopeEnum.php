 * Please note the values are case sensitive.
 * 
 * If the value is `SENT`, the webhook will be called when a status update becomes available for a message you sent (i.e. a mobile terminating (MT) message).
 * 
 * If the value is `RECEIVED`, the webhook will be called when a message is received (i.e. a mobile originating (MO) message).
 * 
 * Note that this field forces you to create two separate webhook entries if you want to collect all messages.  However,  you can use the same `url` for both webhooks if you want.
