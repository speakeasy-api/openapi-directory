 * GoogleIdentityAccesscontextmanagerV1EgressTo - Defines the conditions under which an EgressPolicy matches a request. Conditions are based on information about the ApiOperation intended to be performed on the `resources` specified.

The request must match `operations` AND `resources` fields in order to be allowed egress out of the perimeter.
