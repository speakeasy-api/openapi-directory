 * OSPolicyAssignmentInput - OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to apply a set of OS policies to a dynamically targeted group of Compute Engine VM instances. An OS policy is used to define the desired state configuration for a Compute Engine VM instance through a set of configuration resources that provide capabilities such as installing or removing software packages, or executing a script. For more information about the OS policy resource definitions and examples, see [OS policy and OS policy assignment](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-configuration-management/working-with-os-policies).
