## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `CreateBatchInferenceJob` - Creates a batch inference job. The operation can handle up to 50 million records and the input file must be in JSON format. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/creating-batch-inference-job.html">Creating a batch inference job</a>. 
* `CreateBatchSegmentJob` - Creates a batch segment job. The operation can handle up to 50 million records and the input file must be in JSON format. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recommendations-batch.html">Getting batch recommendations and user segments</a>.
* `CreateCampaign` - <p>Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html">GetRecommendations</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html">GetPersonalizedRanking</a> APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.</p> <p> <b>Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling</b> </p> <p>A transaction is a single <code>GetRecommendations</code> or <code>GetPersonalizedRanking</code> call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (<code>minProvisionedTPS</code>) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. </p> <p> If your TPS increases beyond <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions.</p> <p>The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a 5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the <code>minProvisionedTPS</code> as necessary.</p> <p> <b>Status</b> </p> <p>A campaign can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the campaign status, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeCampaign.html">DescribeCampaign</a>.</p> <note> <p>Wait until the <code>status</code> of the campaign is <code>ACTIVE</code> before asking the campaign for recommendations.</p> </note> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListCampaigns.html">ListCampaigns</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeCampaign.html">DescribeCampaign</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UpdateCampaign.html">UpdateCampaign</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteCampaign.html">DeleteCampaign</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateDataset` - <p>Creates an empty dataset and adds it to the specified dataset group. Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetImportJob.html">CreateDatasetImportJob</a> to import your training data to a dataset.</p> <p>There are three types of datasets:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Interactions</p> </li> <li> <p>Items</p> </li> <li> <p>Users</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each dataset type has an associated schema with required field types. Only the <code>Interactions</code> dataset is required in order to train a model (also referred to as creating a solution).</p> <p>A dataset can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the status of the dataset, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html">DescribeDataset</a>.</p> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetGroup.html">CreateDatasetGroup</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListDatasets.html">ListDatasets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html">DescribeDataset</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteDataset.html">DeleteDataset</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateDatasetExportJob` - <p> Creates a job that exports data from your dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket. To allow Amazon Personalize to export the training data, you must specify an service-linked IAM role that gives Amazon Personalize <code>PutObject</code> permissions for your Amazon S3 bucket. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/export-data.html">Exporting a dataset</a> in the Amazon Personalize developer guide. </p> <p> <b>Status</b> </p> <p>A dataset export job can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> </ul> <p> To get the status of the export job, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetExportJob.html">DescribeDatasetExportJob</a>, and specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset export job. The dataset export is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a <code>failureReason</code> key, which describes why the job failed. </p>
* `CreateDatasetGroup` - <p>Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group is a container for Amazon Personalize resources. A dataset group can contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Interactions</p> </li> <li> <p>Items</p> </li> <li> <p>Users</p> </li> </ul> <p> A dataset group can be a Domain dataset group, where you specify a domain and use pre-configured resources like recommenders, or a Custom dataset group, where you use custom resources, such as a solution with a solution version, that you deploy with a campaign. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can still add custom resources such as solutions and solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases and deployed with campaigns. </p> <p>A dataset group can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the status of the dataset group, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetGroup.html">DescribeDatasetGroup</a>. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a <code>failureReason</code> key, which describes why the creation failed.</p> <note> <p>You must wait until the <code>status</code> of the dataset group is <code>ACTIVE</code> before adding a dataset to the group.</p> </note> <p>You can specify an Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in the group. If you specify a KMS key, you must also include an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to access the key.</p> <p class="title"> <b>APIs that require a dataset group ARN in the request</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateDataset.html">CreateDataset</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateEventTracker.html">CreateEventTracker</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolution.html">CreateSolution</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListDatasetGroups.html">ListDatasetGroups</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetGroup.html">DescribeDatasetGroup</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteDatasetGroup.html">DeleteDatasetGroup</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateDatasetImportJob` - <p>Creates a job that imports training data from your data source (an Amazon S3 bucket) to an Amazon Personalize dataset. To allow Amazon Personalize to import the training data, you must specify an IAM service role that has permission to read from the data source, as Amazon Personalize makes a copy of your data and processes it internally. For information on granting access to your Amazon S3 bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/granting-personalize-s3-access.html">Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources</a>. </p> <important> <p>By default, a dataset import job replaces any existing data in the dataset that you imported in bulk. To add new records without replacing existing data, specify INCREMENTAL for the import mode in the CreateDatasetImportJob operation.</p> </important> <p> <b>Status</b> </p> <p>A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the status of the import job, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetImportJob.html">DescribeDatasetImportJob</a>, providing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job. The dataset import is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a <code>failureReason</code> key, which describes why the job failed.</p> <note> <p>Importing takes time. You must wait until the status shows as ACTIVE before training a model using the dataset.</p> </note> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListDatasetImportJobs.html">ListDatasetImportJobs</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetImportJob.html">DescribeDatasetImportJob</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateEventTracker` - <p>Creates an event tracker that you use when adding event data to a specified dataset group using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html">PutEvents</a> API.</p> <note> <p>Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will get an error if you call <code>CreateEventTracker</code> using the same dataset group as an existing event tracker.</p> </note> <p>When you create an event tracker, the response includes a tracking ID, which you pass as a parameter when you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html">PutEvents</a> operation. Amazon Personalize then appends the event data to the Interactions dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker. </p> <p>The event tracker can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the status of the event tracker, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeEventTracker.html">DescribeEventTracker</a>.</p> <note> <p>The event tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the tracking ID.</p> </note> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListEventTrackers.html">ListEventTrackers</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeEventTracker.html">DescribeEventTracker</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteEventTracker.html">DeleteEventTracker</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateFilter` - Creates a recommendation filter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html">Filtering recommendations and user segments</a>.
* `CreateMetricAttribution` - Creates a metric attribution. A metric attribution creates reports on the data that you import into Amazon Personalize. Depending on how you imported the data, you can view reports in Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/measuring-recommendation-impact.html">Measuring impact of recommendations</a>.
* `CreateRecommender` - <p>Creates a recommender with the recipe (a Domain dataset group use case) you specify. You create recommenders for a Domain dataset group and specify the recommender's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html">GetRecommendations</a> request. </p> <p> <b>Minimum recommendation requests per second</b> </p> <p>When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's minimum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation requests per second (<code>minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond</code>) specifies the baseline recommendation request throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize. The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is <code>1</code>. A recommendation request is a single <code>GetRecommendations</code> operation. Request throughput is measured in requests per second and Amazon Personalize uses your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and the price of your recommender usage. </p> <p> If your requests per second increases beyond <code>minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond</code>, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below <code>minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond</code>. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of requests.</p> <p> Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based on minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or the actual number of requests. The actual request throughput used is calculated as the average requests/second within a one-hour window. We recommend starting with the default <code>minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond</code>, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the <code>minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond</code> as necessary. </p> <p> <b>Status</b> </p> <p>A recommender can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>STOP PENDING &gt; STOP IN_PROGRESS &gt; INACTIVE &gt; START PENDING &gt; START IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the recommender status, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeRecommender.html">DescribeRecommender</a>.</p> <note> <p>Wait until the <code>status</code> of the recommender is <code>ACTIVE</code> before asking the recommender for recommendations.</p> </note> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListRecommenders.html">ListRecommenders</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeRecommender.html">DescribeRecommender</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UpdateRecommender.html">UpdateRecommender</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteRecommender.html">DeleteRecommender</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateSchema` - <p>Creates an Amazon Personalize schema from the specified schema string. The schema you create must be in Avro JSON format.</p> <p>Amazon Personalize recognizes three schema variants. Each schema is associated with a dataset type and has a set of required field and keywords. If you are creating a schema for a dataset in a Domain dataset group, you provide the domain of the Domain dataset group. You specify a schema when you call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateDataset.html">CreateDataset</a>.</p> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListSchemas.html">ListSchemas</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSchema.html">DescribeSchema</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DeleteSchema.html">DeleteSchema</a> </p> </li> </ul>
* `CreateSolution` - <p>Creates the configuration for training a model. A trained model is known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you train the model (create a solution) by calling the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolutionVersion.html">CreateSolutionVersion</a> operation. Every time you call <code>CreateSolutionVersion</code>, a new version of the solution is created.</p> <p>After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_GetSolutionMetrics.html">GetSolutionMetrics</a>. When you are satisfied with the version, you deploy it using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateCampaign.html">CreateCampaign</a>. The campaign provides recommendations to a client through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html">GetRecommendations</a> API.</p> <p>To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature transformation. You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided by Amazon Personalize. Alternatively, you can specify <code>performAutoML</code> and Amazon Personalize will analyze your data and select the optimum USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe for you.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Personalize doesn't support configuring the <code>hpoObjective</code> for solution hyperparameter optimization at this time.</p> </note> <p> <b>Status</b> </p> <p>A solution can be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS</p> </li> </ul> <p>To get the status of the solution, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSolution.html">DescribeSolution</a>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
