    r"""Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports.
    
     Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. 
    
     Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex paper filings take longer to process. 
    
     The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](https://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf), for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC [Form 3](https://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees; [Form 3X](https://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties; and [Form 3P](https://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.
