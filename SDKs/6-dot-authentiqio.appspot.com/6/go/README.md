## SDK Available Operations

### delete

* `KeyRevoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `KeyRevokeNosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `SignDelete` - delete a verification job

### get

* `KeyRetrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `SignRetrieve` - get the status / current content of a verification job

### head

* `HeadKeyPk` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `SignRetrieveHead` - HEAD to get the status of a verification job

### key

* `HeadKeyPk` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `KeyBind` - Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.

v4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; 

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes
and PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `KeyRegister` - Register a new ID `JWT(sub, devtoken)`

v5: `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `KeyRetrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `KeyRevoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `KeyRevokeNosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `KeyUpdate` - update properties of an Authentiq ID.
(not operational in v4; use PUT for now)

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes in
a self-signed JWT

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples
