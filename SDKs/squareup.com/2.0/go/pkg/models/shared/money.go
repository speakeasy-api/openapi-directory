// Money - Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.
// Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are
// considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the
// sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See
// [Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)
// for more information.
