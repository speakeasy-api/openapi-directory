// SessionStickinessConfig - Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to your staging distribution, while others are sent to your primary distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values.
