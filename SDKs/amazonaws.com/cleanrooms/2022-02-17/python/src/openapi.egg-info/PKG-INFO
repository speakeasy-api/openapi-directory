## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `batch_get_schema` - Retrieves multiple schemas by their identifiers.
* `create_collaboration` - Creates a new collaboration.
* `create_configured_table` - Creates a new configured table resource.
* `create_configured_table_analysis_rule` - Creates a new analysis rule for a configured table. Currently, only one analysis rule can be created for a given configured table.
* `create_configured_table_association` - Creates a configured table association. A configured table association links a configured table with a collaboration.
* `create_membership` - Creates a membership for a specific collaboration identifier and joins the collaboration.
* `delete_collaboration` - Deletes a collaboration. It can only be called by the collaboration owner.
* `delete_configured_table` - Deletes a configured table.
* `delete_configured_table_analysis_rule` - Deletes a configured table analysis rule.
* `delete_configured_table_association` - Deletes a configured table association.
* `delete_member` - Removes the specified member from a collaboration. The removed member is placed in the Removed status and can't interact with the collaboration. The removed member's data is inaccessible to active members of the collaboration.
* `delete_membership` - Deletes a specified membership. All resources under a membership must be deleted.
* `get_collaboration` - Returns metadata about a collaboration.
* `get_configured_table` - Retrieves a configured table.
* `get_configured_table_analysis_rule` - Retrieves a configured table analysis rule.
* `get_configured_table_association` - Retrieves a configured table association.
* `get_membership` - Retrieves a specified membership for an identifier.
* `get_protected_query` - Returns query processing metadata.
* `get_schema` - Retrieves the schema for a relation within a collaboration.
* `get_schema_analysis_rule` - Retrieves a schema analysis rule.

* `list_configured_table_associations` - Lists configured table associations for a membership.
* `list_configured_tables` - Lists configured tables.
* `list_members` - Lists all members within a collaboration.
* `list_memberships` - Lists all memberships resources within the caller's account.
* `list_protected_queries` - Lists protected queries, sorted by the most recent query.
* `list_schemas` - Lists the schemas for relations within a collaboration.
* `list_tags_for_resource` - Lists all of the tags that have been added to a resource.
* `start_protected_query` - Creates a protected query that is started by AWS Clean Rooms.
* `tag_resource` - Tags a resource.
* `untag_resource` - Removes a tag or list of tags from a resource.
* `update_collaboration` - Updates collaboration metadata and can only be called by the collaboration owner.
* `update_configured_table` - Updates a configured table.
* `update_configured_table_analysis_rule` - Updates a configured table analysis rule.
* `update_configured_table_association` - Updates a configured table association.
* `update_membership` - Updates a membership.
* `update_protected_query` - Updates the processing of a currently running query.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
