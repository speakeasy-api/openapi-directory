/**
 * InvoiceTaxSystemEnum - The tax system used for the invoice. The system 'tax_line_percentages' is preferred, but for historic purposes 'tax_line_amounts' is supported and the default. Since not all invoice formats that we are required to send support 'tax_line_amounts' we will need to convert the invoice to the 'tax_line_percentags' system if we are forced to send the invoice in that tax system. Note that an invoice must always contain tax information, even if that is 0% or an item or sender is exempt or tax is completely outside scope. In that case, use the correct tax categories (see &lt;&lt;_openapi_tax&gt;&gt;)
