"""Contains the list of servers available to the SDK"""

class SDK:
    r"""This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.
    
    The Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a verification check or a payout has been completed.
    
    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).
    ## Authentication
    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:
    
     ```
    curl
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \
    ...
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:
    
    ```
    curl
    -U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    ...
    ```
    When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).
    
    ## Versioning
    The Notification Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.
    
    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration
    ```
