/** Set the relative priority for this notification. Priority is an indication of how much of the user's attention should be consumed by this notification. Low-priority notifications may be hidden from the user in certain situations, while the user might be interrupted for a higher-priority notification. The effect of setting the same priorities may differ slightly on different platforms. Note this priority differs from `AndroidMessagePriority`. This priority is processed by the client after the message has been delivered, whereas [AndroidMessagePriority](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#androidmessagepriority) is an FCM concept that controls when the message is delivered. */
