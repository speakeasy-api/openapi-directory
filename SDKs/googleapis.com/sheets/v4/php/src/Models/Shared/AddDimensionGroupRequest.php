/**
 * AddDimensionGroupRequest - Creates a group over the specified range. If the requested range is a superset of the range of an existing group G, then the depth of G is incremented and this new group G' has the depth of that group. For example, a group [C:D, depth 1] + [B:E] results in groups [B:E, depth 1] and [C:D, depth 2]. If the requested range is a subset of the range of an existing group G, then the depth of the new group G' becomes one greater than the depth of G. For example, a group [B:E, depth 1] + [C:D] results in groups [B:E, depth 1] and [C:D, depth 2]. If the requested range starts before and ends within, or starts within and ends after, the range of an existing group G, then the range of the existing group G becomes the union of the ranges, and the new group G' has depth one greater than the depth of G and range as the intersection of the ranges. For example, a group [B:D, depth 1] + [C:E] results in groups [B:E, depth 1] and [C:D, depth 2].
