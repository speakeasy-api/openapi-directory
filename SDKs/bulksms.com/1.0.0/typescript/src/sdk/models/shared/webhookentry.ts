 *
 * If the value is `ONE` the array POSTed to your webhook will contain no more than a single message.  Use this option if your webhook logic is unable to handle more than one messages at a time.
 *
 * If the value is `MANY` the array POSTed to your webhook can contain up to 10 messages.  This is the recommended option.  The number of calls made to your webhook would be less and this will speed up your total processing time.
 * If your webhook fails for an invoke that has more than one message, each message in the array will automatically be retried one at a time.
 *
 * This value defaults to `ONE` - but it is recommended that you set this property to `MANY`.
