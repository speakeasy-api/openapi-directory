// RecognizedEntity - An entity is a single piece of data that was recognized in unstructured text.  For example, a city, a postal code, package dimensions, insured value, etc.  Each entity includes the original text and the parsed value.
type RecognizedEntity struct {
	// The index of the last character of this entity within the original text
	EndIndex int64 `json:"end_index"`
	// The normalized value of the entity.
	//
	// Most entity results have a `value` field, which is the normalized value of the entity.  For example, if the substring "john doe" was recognized as a "person" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to "Fort Worth".
	//
	// Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.
	//
	Result map[string]interface{} `json:"result,omitempty"`
	// A confidence score between zero and one that indicates how certain the API is that it correctly recognized this entity
	//
	Score float64 `json:"score"`
	// The index of the first character of this entity within the original text
	StartIndex int64 `json:"start_index"`
	// The substring from the original text that was recognized as this entity
	Text string `json:"text"`
	// The Entity type (e.g. "weight", "person", "address_line1", etc.)
	Type string `json:"type"`
