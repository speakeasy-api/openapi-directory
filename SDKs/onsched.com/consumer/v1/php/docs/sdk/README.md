## Overview

Build secure and scalable custom apps for Online Booking. Our flexible API provides many options for availability and booking.
<br><br>
Take the API for a test drive. Just click on the Authorize button below and authenticate. 
You can access our demo company profile if you are not a customer, or your own profile by using your assigned ClientId and Secret.
<br><br>
The API has two interfaces, consumer and setup. 
<ul>
<li>
The consumer interface provides all the endpoints required for implementing consumer booking flows.
</li>
<li>
The setup interface provides endpoints for profile configuration and setup.
</li>
</ul>
Toggle freely between the two interfaces using the swagger tool bar option labelled 'Select a definition'.
