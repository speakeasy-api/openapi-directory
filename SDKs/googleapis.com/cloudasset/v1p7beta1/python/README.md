## Available Resources and Operations


### operations

* `cloudasset_operations_get` - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

### v1p7beta1

* `cloudasset_export_assets` - Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1p7beta1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset proto as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API , which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
