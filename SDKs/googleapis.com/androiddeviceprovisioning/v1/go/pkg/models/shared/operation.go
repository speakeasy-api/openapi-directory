// Operation - This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
type Operation struct {
	// If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
	Done *bool `json:"done,omitempty"`
	// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
	Error *Status `json:"error,omitempty"`
	// This field will contain a `DevicesLongRunningOperationMetadata` object if the operation is created by `claimAsync`, `unclaimAsync`, or `updateMetadataAsync`.
	Metadata map[string]interface{} `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	// The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// This field will contain a `DevicesLongRunningOperationResponse` object if the operation is created by `claimAsync`, `unclaimAsync`, or `updateMetadataAsync`.
	Response map[string]interface{} `json:"response,omitempty"`
