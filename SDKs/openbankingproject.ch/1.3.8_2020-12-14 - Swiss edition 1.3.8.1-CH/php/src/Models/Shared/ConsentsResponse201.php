     * A list of hyperlinks to be recognised by the TPP.
     * 
     * 
     * Type of links admitted in this response (which might be extended by single ASPSPs as indicated in its XS2A
     * documentation):
     *   * 'scaRedirect': 
     *     In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link to which to redirect the 
     *     PSU browser.
     *   * 'scaOAuth': 
     *     In case of an OAuth2 based Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link where the configuration 
     *     of the OAuth2 Server is defined. 
     *     The configuration follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Server Metadata specification. 
     * * 'confirmation': 
     *   Might be added by the ASPSP if either the "scaRedirect" or "scaOAuth" hyperlink is returned 
     *   in the same response message. 
     *   This hyperlink defines the URL to the resource which needs to be updated with 
     *     * a confirmation code as retrieved after the plain redirect authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server or
     *     * an access token as retrieved by submitting an authorization code after the integrated OAuth based authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server.
     *   * 'startAuthorisation': 
     *     In case, where an explicit start of the transaction authorisation is needed, 
     *     but no more data needs to be updated (no authentication method to be selected, 
     *     no PSU identification nor PSU authentication data to be uploaded).
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification': 
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
     *     while uploading the PSU identification data.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
     *     while uploading the PSU authentication data.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication':
     *     Same as startAuthorisactionWithPsuAuthentication where the authentication data need to be encrypted on
     *     application layer in uploading.
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthenticationMethodSelection':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
     *     while selecting the authentication method. This link is contained under exactly the same conditions 
     *     as the data element 'scaMethods' 
     *   * 'startAuthorisationWithTransactionAuthorisation':
     *     The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
     *     while authorising the transaction e.g. by uploading an OTP received by SMS.
     *   * 'self': 
     *     The link to the Establish Account Information Consent resource created by this request. 
     *     This link can be used to retrieve the resource data. 
     *   * 'status': 
     *     The link to retrieve the status of the account information consent.
     *   * 'scaStatus': The link to retrieve the scaStatus of the corresponding authorisation sub-resource. 
     *     This link is only contained, if an authorisation sub-resource has been already created.
