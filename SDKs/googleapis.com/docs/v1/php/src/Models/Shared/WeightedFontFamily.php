     * The weight of the font. This field can have any value that's a multiple of `100` between `100` and `900`, inclusive. This range corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1 Specification, [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness), with non-numerical values disallowed. The default value is `400` ("normal"). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style's resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.
