Beginning **March 25, 2023**, the behavior of this field may change in the following ways with the replacement of targeting expansion with [optimized targeting](//support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12060859): * This field will represent the optimized targeting checkbox, with a `NO_EXPANSION` value representing optimized targeting turned off and a `LEAST_EXPANSION` value representing optimized targeting turned on. * `NO_EXPANSION` will be the default value for the field and will be automatically assigned if you do not set the field. * If you set the field to any value other than `NO_EXPANSION`, it will automatically be set to `LEAST_EXPANSION`. This behavior will be rolled out to all partners by early May 2023.

// TargetingExpansionConfig - Settings that control the targeting expansion of the line item. Targeting expansion allows the line item to reach a larger audience based on the original audience list and the targeting expansion level. Beginning **March 25, 2023**, these settings may represent the [optimized targeting feature](//support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12060859) in place of targeting expansion. This feature will be rolled out to all partners by early May 2023.

Only applicable when a first-party audience is positively targeted (directly or included in a combined audience), otherwise this selection will be ignored. Beginning **March 25, 2023**, this field may be deprecated with the replacement of targeting expansion with [optimized targeting](//support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12060859).
