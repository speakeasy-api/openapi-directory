## Available Resources and Operations


### charity_org

* `get_charity_org` - This call is used to retrieve detailed information about supported charitable organizations. It allows users to retrieve the details for a specific charitable organization using its charity organization ID.
* `get_charity_orgs` - This call is used to search for supported charitable organizations. It allows users to search for a specific charitable organization, or for multiple charitable organizations, from a particular charitable domain and/or geographical region, or by using search criteria.<br /><br />The call returns paginated search results containing the charitable organizations that match the specified criteria.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
