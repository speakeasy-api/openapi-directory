     * Schema Response Actions are objects that when created cause state transitions for Schema Responses. Users use state transitions to submit, approve, and revise new Schema Responses.
     * 
     * 
     * Schema Response Actions have a  few different triggers to cause state transitions:
     * 
     *   - `submit` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `in_progress` state to an `unapproved` state,
     *   this freezes edits for the Schema Response and allows all admin contributors to the Schema Response's
     *   Registration to either approved or reject the Schema Response.
     * 
     *   - `approve` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an `approved` state, this
     *   makes the Schema Response changes public completing the update of the Schema Response. On Schema Responses that
     *   are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow the `approve` trigger
     *   will transition the Schema Response to `pending_moderation`.
     * 
     *   - `accept` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an `approved`
     *   state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration that has
     *   Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
     *   Registration Provider.
     * 
     *   - `admin_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an
     *   `in_progress`  state. This trigger allows users to reject purposed changes to a Schema Response.
     * 
     *   - `moderator_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an
     *   `in_progress`  state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration
     *   that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
     *   Registration Provider.

     * Schema Responses contain user supplied responses to a Registration Schema. A Schema Response aggregates all of the the responses for a given version of a Registration's Registration Schema. Schema Responses are created when a Registration is completed. Once a Registration is completed the Schema Responses for a Registration can be revisied and updated by using it's associated action endpoints.
     * 
     * 
     * There are a few states for Schema Responses:
     * 
     *   - `initial` is the state of a Schema Response on a newly registered Registration, to edit a Schema Response you
     *   must create a Schema Response Action that triggers a new submission.
     * 
     *   - `in_progess` is the state of a Schema Response where the response is editable and still private, Schema
     *   Responses are editted via a PATCH request as specified below.
     * 
     *   - `unapproved` is the state of a Schema Response where edits have been made and "locked-in", now contributors
     *   have the ability to reject the changes, however if they are not rejected changes are automatically approved
     *   after 48 hours. If `unapproved` Schema Responses are rejected, they are returned to the `in_progress` state. If
     *   `unapproved` Schema Responses are approved they either enter an `approved` state or go into a
     *   `pending_moderation` to be accepted or denied by a moderator.
     * 
     *   - `pending_moderation` is the state of a Schema Response where moderators have an opportunity to reject or
     *   approve a Schema Response that has been approved by it's contributors. This state is only reachable for Schema
     *   Responses that are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow.
     * 
     *   - `approved` is the state of a Schema Response where it is public and immutable, in order to update an approved
     *   Schema Response a new one must be created.
