## SDK Available Operations


### forms

* `formsFormsBatchUpdate` - Change the form with a batch of updates.
* `formsFormsCreate` - Create a new form using the title given in the provided form message in the request. *Important:* Only the form.info.title and form.info.document_title fields are copied to the new form. All other fields including the form description, items and settings are disallowed. To create a new form and add items, you must first call forms.create to create an empty form with a title and (optional) document title, and then call forms.update to add the items.
* `formsFormsGet` - Get a form.
* `formsFormsResponsesGet` - Get one response from the form.
* `formsFormsResponsesList` - List a form's responses.
* `formsFormsWatchesCreate` - Create a new watch. If a watch ID is provided, it must be unused. For each invoking project, the per form limit is one watch per Watch.EventType. A watch expires seven days after it is created (see Watch.expire_time).
* `formsFormsWatchesDelete` - Delete a watch.
* `formsFormsWatchesList` - Return a list of the watches owned by the invoking project. The maximum number of watches is two: For each invoker, the limit is one for each event type per form.
* `formsFormsWatchesRenew` - Renew an existing watch for seven days. The state of the watch after renewal is `ACTIVE`, and the `expire_time` is seven days from the renewal. Renewing a watch in an error state (e.g. `SUSPENDED`) succeeds if the error is no longer present, but fail otherwise. After a watch has expired, RenewWatch returns `NOT_FOUND`.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
