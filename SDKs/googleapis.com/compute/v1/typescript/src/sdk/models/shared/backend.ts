A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not available with backends that don't support using a balancingMode.
