	IgnoredResources []string `json:"ignoredResources,omitempty"`
	// Map from full resource types to the effective short name for the resource. This is used when otherwise resource named from different services would cause naming collisions. Example entry: "datalabeling.googleapis.com/Dataset": "DataLabelingDataset"

	// Map from original service names to renamed versions. This is used when the default generated types would cause a naming conflict. (Neither name is fully-qualified.) Example: Subscriber to SubscriberServiceApi.
