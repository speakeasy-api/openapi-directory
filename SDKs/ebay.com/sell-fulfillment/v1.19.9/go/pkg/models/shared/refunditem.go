// RefundItem - This type is used if the seller is issuing a refund for one or more individual order line items in a multiple line item order. Otherwise, the seller just uses the orderLevelRefundAmount container to specify the amount of the refund for the entire order.
type RefundItem struct {
	// Type defining the legacyReference container. This container is needed if the seller is issuing a refund for an individual order line item, and wishes to use an item ID and transaction ID to identify the order line item.
	LegacyReference *LegacyReference `json:"legacyReference,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier of an order line item. This identifier is created once a buyer purchases a 'Buy It Now' item or if an auction listing ends with a winning bidder. Either this field or the legacyReference container is needed to identify an individual order line item that will receive a refund. Note: The lineItemId field is used to identify an order line item in REST API format, and the legacyReference container is used to identify an order line item in Trading/legacy API format. Both legacy and REST API identifiers are returned in getOrder (Fulfillment API) and GetOrders (Trading API).
	LineItemID *string `json:"lineItemId,omitempty"`
	// This type defines the monetary value of the payment dispute, and the currency used.
	RefundAmount *SimpleAmount `json:"refundAmount,omitempty"`
}
