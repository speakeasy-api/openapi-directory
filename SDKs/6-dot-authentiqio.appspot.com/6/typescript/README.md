## SDK Available Operations

### delete

* `keyRevoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `keyRevokeNosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `signDelete` - delete a verification job

### get

* `keyRetrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `signRetrieve` - get the status / current content of a verification job

### head

* `headKeyPk` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `signRetrieveHead` - HEAD to get the status of a verification job

### key

* `headKeyPk` - HEAD info on Authentiq ID

* `keyBind` - Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.

v4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; 

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes
and PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `keyRegister` - Register a new ID `JWT(sub, devtoken)`

v5: `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`

See: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples

* `keyRetrieve` - Get public details of an Authentiq ID.

* `keyRevoke` - Revoke an Identity (Key) with a revocation secret
* `keyRevokeNosecret` - Revoke an Authentiq ID using email & phone.

If called with `email` and `phone` only, a verification code 
will be sent by email. Do a second call adding `code` to 
complete the revocation.

* `keyUpdate` - update properties of an Authentiq ID.
(not operational in v4; use PUT for now)

v5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes in
a self-signed JWT
