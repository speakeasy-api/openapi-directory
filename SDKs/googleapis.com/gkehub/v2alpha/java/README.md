## Available Resources and Operations


### [projects](docs/projects/README.md)

* [gkehubProjectsLocationsList](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationslist) - Lists information about the supported locations for this service.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsCancel](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationscancel) - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsGet](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationsget) - Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.
* [gkehubProjectsLocationsOperationsList](docs/projects/README.md#gkehubprojectslocationsoperationslist) - Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage 
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally 
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
