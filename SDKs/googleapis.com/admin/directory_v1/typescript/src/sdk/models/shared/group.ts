 * Google Groups provide your users the ability to send messages to groups of people using the group's email address.

Note: The user calling the API (or being impersonated by a service account) must have an assigned [role](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-roles) that includes Admin API Groups permissions, such as Super Admin or Groups Admin.
