### Assets

* `PolyAssetsGet` - Returns detailed information about an asset given its name. PRIVATE assets are returned only if the currently authenticated user (via OAuth token) is the author of the asset.
* `PolyAssetsList` - Lists all public, remixable assets. These are assets with an access level of PUBLIC and published under the CC-By license.

### Users

* `PolyUsersAssetsList` - Lists assets authored by the given user. Only the value 'me', representing the currently-authenticated user, is supported. May include assets with an access level of PRIVATE or UNLISTED and assets which are All Rights Reserved for the currently-authenticated user.
* `PolyUsersLikedassetsList` - Lists assets that the user has liked. Only the value 'me', representing the currently-authenticated user, is supported. May include assets with an access level of UNLISTED.
