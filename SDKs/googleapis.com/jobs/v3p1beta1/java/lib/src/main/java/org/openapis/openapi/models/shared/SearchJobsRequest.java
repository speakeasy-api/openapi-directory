When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query "program manager," a result is returned even if the job posting has the title "software developer," which does not fall into "program manager" ontology, but does have "program manager" appearing in its description. For queries like "cloud" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with "cloud" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.

"`distance_from(19.89, 155.5)`": Order by distance from a coordinate. "`distance_from('Hawaii'), distance_from('Puerto Rico')`": Order by multiple locations. See details below.

When a job has multiple locations, the job location closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that don't have locations will be ranked at the bottom.
