/** <p>Per the MPEG-DASH specification, the wall-clock time of fragments in the manifest file can be derived using attributes in the manifest itself. However, typically, MPEG-DASH compatible media players do not properly handle gaps in the media timeline. Kinesis Video Streams adjusts the media timeline in the manifest file to enable playback of media with discontinuities. Therefore, the wall-clock time derived from the manifest file may be inaccurate. If DisplayFragmentTimestamp is set to <code>ALWAYS</code>, the accurate fragment timestamp is added to each S element in the manifest file with the attribute name “kvs:ts”. A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary to leverage this custom attribute.</p> <p>The default value is <code>NEVER</code>. When <a>DASHFragmentSelector</a> is <code>SERVER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when <a>DASHFragmentSelector</a> is <code>PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps. </p> */
