    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "<UNSET>.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "openapi/openapi": "*"

```

Then run the following command:

```bash
composer update

    $request->xAmzSignedHeaders = 'corrupti';
    $request->catalog = 'illum';
    $request->changeSetId = 'vel';

    $response = $sdk->cancelChangeSet($request);

    if ($response->cancelChangeSetResponse !== null) {
        // handle response
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // handle exception
}

## Available Resources and Operations

### [SDK](docs/sdk/README.md)

* [cancelChangeSet](docs/sdk/README.md#cancelchangeset) - Used to cancel an open change request. Must be sent before the status of the request changes to <code>APPLYING</code>, the final stage of completing your change request. You can describe a change during the 60-day request history retention period for API calls.
* [deleteResourcePolicy](docs/sdk/README.md#deleteresourcepolicy) - Deletes a resource-based policy on an Entity that is identified by its resource ARN.
* [describeChangeSet](docs/sdk/README.md#describechangeset) - Provides information about a given change set.
* [describeEntity](docs/sdk/README.md#describeentity) - Returns the metadata and content of the entity.
* [getResourcePolicy](docs/sdk/README.md#getresourcepolicy) - Gets a resource-based policy of an Entity that is identified by its resource ARN.
* [listChangeSets](docs/sdk/README.md#listchangesets) - <p>Returns the list of change sets owned by the account being used to make the call. You can filter this list by providing any combination of <code>entityId</code>, <code>ChangeSetName</code>, and status. If you provide more than one filter, the API operation applies a logical AND between the filters.</p> <p>You can describe a change during the 60-day request history retention period for API calls.</p>
* [listEntities](docs/sdk/README.md#listentities) - Provides the list of entities of a given type.
* [listTagsForResource](docs/sdk/README.md#listtagsforresource) - Lists all tags that have been added to a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).
* [putResourcePolicy](docs/sdk/README.md#putresourcepolicy) - Attaches a resource-based policy to an Entity. Examples of an entity include: <code>AmiProduct</code> and <code>ContainerProduct</code>.
* [startChangeSet](docs/sdk/README.md#startchangeset) - <p>Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single <code>ChangeSet</code>, you can't start the same change type against the same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a <code>ChangeSet</code> is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will receive a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> error.</p> <p>For example, you can't start the <code>ChangeSet</code> described in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples">example</a> later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same change type (<code>AddRevisions</code>) against the same entity (<code>entity-id@1</code>).</p> <p>For more information about working with change sets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets"> Working with change sets</a>. For information on change types for single-AMI products, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/ami-products.html#working-with-single-AMI-products">Working with single-AMI products</a>. Als, for more information on change types available for container-based products, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/container-products.html#working-with-container-products">Working with container products</a>.</p>
* [tagResource](docs/sdk/README.md#tagresource) - Tags a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).
* [untagResource](docs/sdk/README.md#untagresource) - Removes a tag or list of tags from a resource (either an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#catalog-api-entities">entity</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html#working-with-change-sets">change set</a>).

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
