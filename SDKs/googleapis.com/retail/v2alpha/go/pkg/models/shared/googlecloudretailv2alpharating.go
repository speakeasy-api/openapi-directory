type GoogleCloudRetailV2alphaRating struct {
	// The average rating of the Product. The rating is scaled at 1-5. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
	AverageRating *float32 `json:"averageRating,omitempty"`
	// The total number of ratings. This value is independent of the value of rating_histogram. This value must be nonnegative. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

	// List of rating counts per rating value (index = rating - 1). The list is empty if there is no rating. If the list is non-empty, its size is always 5. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. For example, [41, 14, 13, 47, 303]. It means that the Product got 41 ratings with 1 star, 14 ratings with 2 star, and so on.
