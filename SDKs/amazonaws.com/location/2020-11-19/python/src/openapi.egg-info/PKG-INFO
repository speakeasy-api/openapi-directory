## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `associate_tracker_consumer` - <p>Creates an association between a geofence collection and a tracker resource. This allows the tracker resource to communicate location data to the linked geofence collection. </p> <p>You can associate up to five geofence collections to each tracker resource.</p> <note> <p>Currently not supported — Cross-account configurations, such as creating associations between a tracker resource in one account and a geofence collection in another account.</p> </note>
* `batch_delete_device_position_history` - Deletes the position history of one or more devices from a tracker resource.
* `batch_delete_geofence` - <p>Deletes a batch of geofences from a geofence collection.</p> <note> <p>This operation deletes the resource permanently.</p> </note>
* `batch_evaluate_geofences` - <p>Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given geofence collection.</p> <p>This operation always returns an empty response because geofences are asynchronously evaluated. The evaluation determines if the device has entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the following events to Amazon EventBridge:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ENTER</code> if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has entered a geofenced area.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>EXIT</code> if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited a geofenced area.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>The last geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for 30 days after the most recent device position update.</p> </note> <note> <p>Geofence evaluation uses the given device position. It does not account for the optional <code>Accuracy</code> of a <code>DevicePositionUpdate</code>.</p> </note> <note> <p>The <code>DeviceID</code> is used as a string to represent the device. You do not need to have a <code>Tracker</code> associated with the <code>DeviceID</code>.</p> </note>
* `batch_get_device_position` - Lists the latest device positions for requested devices.
* `batch_put_geofence` - A batch request for storing geofence geometries into a given geofence collection, or updates the geometry of an existing geofence if a geofence ID is included in the request.
* `batch_update_device_position` - <p>Uploads position update data for one or more devices to a tracker resource. Amazon Location uses the data when it reports the last known device position and position history. Amazon Location retains location data for 30 days.</p> <note> <p>Position updates are handled based on the <code>PositionFiltering</code> property of the tracker. When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>TimeBased</code>, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.</p> <p>When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>DistanceBased</code> filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft).</p> <p>When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, Amazon Location uses the default value <code>{ "Horizontal": 0}</code> when accuracy is not provided on a <code>DevicePositionUpdate</code>.</p> </note>
* `calculate_route` - <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/calculate-route.html">Calculates a route</a> given the following required parameters: <code>DeparturePosition</code> and <code>DestinationPosition</code>. Requires that you first <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location-routes/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRouteCalculator.html">create a route calculator resource</a>.</p> <p>By default, a request that doesn't specify a departure time uses the best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calculating the route.</p> <p>Additional options include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/departure-time.html">Specifying a departure time</a> using either <code>DepartureTime</code> or <code>DepartNow</code>. This calculates a route based on predictive traffic data at the given time. </p> <note> <p>You can't specify both <code>DepartureTime</code> and <code>DepartNow</code> in a single request. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/travel-mode.html">Specifying a travel mode</a> using TravelMode sets the transportation mode used to calculate the routes. This also lets you specify additional route preferences in <code>CarModeOptions</code> if traveling by <code>Car</code>, or <code>TruckModeOptions</code> if traveling by <code>Truck</code>.</p> <note> <p>If you specify <code>walking</code> for the travel mode and your data provider is Esri, the start and destination must be within 40km.</p> </note> </li> </ul>
* `calculate_route_matrix` - <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/calculate-route-matrix.html"> Calculates a route matrix</a> given the following required parameters: <code>DeparturePositions</code> and <code>DestinationPositions</code>. <code>CalculateRouteMatrix</code> calculates routes and returns the travel time and travel distance from each departure position to each destination position in the request. For example, given departure positions A and B, and destination positions X and Y, <code>CalculateRouteMatrix</code> will return time and distance for routes from A to X, A to Y, B to X, and B to Y (in that order). The number of results returned (and routes calculated) will be the number of <code>DeparturePositions</code> times the number of <code>DestinationPositions</code>.</p> <note> <p>Your account is charged for each route calculated, not the number of requests.</p> </note> <p>Requires that you first <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location-routes/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRouteCalculator.html">create a route calculator resource</a>.</p> <p>By default, a request that doesn't specify a departure time uses the best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calculating routes.</p> <p>Additional options include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/departure-time.html"> Specifying a departure time</a> using either <code>DepartureTime</code> or <code>DepartNow</code>.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
