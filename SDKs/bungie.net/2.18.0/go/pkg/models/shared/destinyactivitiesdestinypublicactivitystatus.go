	// Active Challenges for the activity, if any - represented as hashes for DestinyObjectiveDefinitions.

	// If the activity itself provides any specific "mock" rewards, this will be the items and their quantity.
	// Why "mock", you ask? Because these are the rewards as they are represented in the tooltip of the Activity.
	// These are often pointers to fake items that look good in a tooltip, but represent an abstract concept of what you will get for a reward rather than the specific items you may obtain.
