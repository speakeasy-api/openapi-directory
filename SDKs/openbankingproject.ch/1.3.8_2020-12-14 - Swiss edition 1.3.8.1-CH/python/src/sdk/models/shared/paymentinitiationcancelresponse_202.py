    r"""The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table:
    - 'ACCC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
      Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.
    - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' -
      Preceding check of technical validation was successful.
      Customer profile check was also successful.
    - 'ACSC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
      Settlement on the debtoro?=s account has been completed.
    
      **Usage:** this can be used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed.
    
      **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.
      It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
    - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
      All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
    - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
      Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
    - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
      Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
    - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -
      Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customero?=s account.
    - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
      Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
    - 'PDNG': 'Pending' -
      Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending.
      Further checks and status update will be performed.
    - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
      Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
    - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
      Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution
      Remark: This codeis accepted as new code by ISO20022.
    - 'ACFC': 'AcceptedFundsChecked' -
      Preceding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive .
      Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
    - 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'
      Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.
      Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
    - 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -
      A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.
      Remark: This code may be used only in case of bulk payments. It is only used in a situation where all mandated authorisations have been applied, but some payments have been rejected.
