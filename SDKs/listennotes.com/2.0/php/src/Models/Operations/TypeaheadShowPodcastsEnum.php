 * Autosuggest podcasts. This only searches podcast title and publisher and returns very limited info of 5 podcasts. 1 is yes, 0 is no. It's a bit slow to autosuggest podcasts, so we turn it off by default. If show_podcasts=1, you can also pass iTunes id (e.g., 474722933) to the q parameter to fetch podcast meta data.
