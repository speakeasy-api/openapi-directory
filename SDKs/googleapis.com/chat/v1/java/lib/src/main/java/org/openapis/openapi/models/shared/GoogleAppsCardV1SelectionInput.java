 * GoogleAppsCardV1SelectionInput - A widget that creates a UI item with options for users to select. For example, a dropdown menu or check list. Chat apps receive and can process the value of entered text during form input events. For details about working with form inputs, see [Receive form data](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs#receive_form_data_from_dialogs). When you need to collect data from users that matches options you set, use a selection input. To collect abstract data from users, use the text input widget instead.
