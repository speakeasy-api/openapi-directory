* `createScalingPlan` - Creates a scaling plan. 
* `deleteScalingPlan` - <p>Deletes the specified scaling plan.</p> <p>Deleting a scaling plan deletes the underlying <a>ScalingInstruction</a> for all of the scalable resources that are covered by the plan.</p> <p>If the plan has launched resources or has scaling activities in progress, you must delete those resources separately.</p>
* `describeScalingPlanResources` - Describes the scalable resources in the specified scaling plan.
* `describeScalingPlans` - Describes one or more of your scaling plans.
* `getScalingPlanResourceForecastData` - <p>Retrieves the forecast data for a scalable resource.</p> <p>Capacity forecasts are represented as predicted values, or data points, that are calculated using historical data points from a specified CloudWatch load metric. Data points are available for up to 56 days. </p>
* `updateScalingPlan` - <p>Updates the specified scaling plan.</p> <p>You cannot update a scaling plan if it is in the process of being created, updated, or deleted.</p>

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
