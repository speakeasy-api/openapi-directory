	// An account covered by a hold. This structure is immutable. It can be an individual account or a Google Group, depending on the service. To work with Vault resources, the account must have the [required Vault privileges] (https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2799699) and access to the matter.

	// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
