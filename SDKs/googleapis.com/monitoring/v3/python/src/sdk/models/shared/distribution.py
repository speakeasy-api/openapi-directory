class Distribution:
    r"""Distribution contains summary statistics for a population of values. It optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values across a set of buckets.The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths.Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the mean and sum_of_squared_deviation fields meaningless."""

The sum of the values in bucketCounts must equal the value in the count field of the Distribution object. The order of the bucket counts follows the numbering schemes described for the three bucket types. The underflow bucket has number 0; the finite buckets, if any, have numbers 1 through N-2; and the overflow bucket has number N-1. The size of bucket_counts must not be greater than N. If the size is less than N, then the remaining buckets are assigned values of zero."""

    r"""BucketOptions describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram for the distribution. The buckets can be in a linear sequence, an exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly. BucketOptions does not include the number of values in each bucket.A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite."""
