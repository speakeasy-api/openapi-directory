	// The unique identifier of the order. Order IDs are returned in the getOrders method (and GetOrders call of Trading API). The issueRefund method supports the legacy API Order IDs and REST API order IDs. Note: In the Trading API (and other legacy APIs), Order IDs are transitioning to a new format. The new format is a non-parsable string, globally unique across all eBay marketplaces, and consistent for both single line item and multiple line item orders. These order identifiers will be automatically generated after buyer payment, and unlike in the past, instead of just being known and exposed to the seller, these unique order identifiers will also be known and used/referenced by the buyer and eBay customer support. For developers and sellers who are already integrated with the Trading API's order management calls, this change shouldn't impact your integration unless you parse the existing order identifiers (e.g., OrderID or OrderLineItemID), or otherwise infer meaning from the format (e.g., differentiating between a single line item order versus a multiple line item order). Because we realize that some integrations may have logic that is dependent upon the identifier format, eBay is rolling out the Trading API change with version control to support a transition period of approximately 9 months before applications must switch to the new format completely. See the OrderID field description in the GetOrders call for more details and requirements on transitioning to the new Order ID format.
