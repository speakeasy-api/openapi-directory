If no value is specified, GA is assumed. Set the launch stage to a preview stage on input to allow use of preview features in that stage. On read (or output), describes whether the resource uses preview features. For example, if ALPHA is provided as input, but only BETA and GA-level features are used, this field will be BETA on output. */
