    **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
    the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
    Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.
    
    **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
    There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.
