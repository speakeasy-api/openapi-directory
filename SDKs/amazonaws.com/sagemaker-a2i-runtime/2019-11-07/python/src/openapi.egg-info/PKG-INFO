## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `delete_human_loop` - <p>Deletes the specified human loop for a flow definition.</p> <p>If the human loop was deleted, this operation will return a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. </p>
* `describe_human_loop` - Returns information about the specified human loop. If the human loop was deleted, this operation will return a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> error. 
* `list_human_loops` - Returns information about human loops, given the specified parameters. If a human loop was deleted, it will not be included.
* `start_human_loop` - Starts a human loop, provided that at least one activation condition is met.
* `stop_human_loop` - Stops the specified human loop.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
