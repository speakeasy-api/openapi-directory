// DeviceReference - A `DeviceReference` is an API abstraction that lets you supply a _device_ argument to a method using one of the following identifier types: * A numeric API resource ID. * Real-world hardware IDs, such as IMEI number, belonging to the manufactured device. Methods that operate on devices take a `DeviceReference` as a parameter type because it's more flexible for the caller. To learn more about device identifiers, read [Identifiers](https://developers.google.com/zero-touch/guides/identifiers).
type DeviceReference struct {
	// The ID of the device.
	DeviceID *string `json:"deviceId,omitempty"`
	// Encapsulates hardware and product IDs to identify a manufactured device. To understand requirements on identifier sets, read [Identifiers](https://developers.google.com/zero-touch/guides/identifiers).
	DeviceIdentifier *DeviceIdentifier `json:"deviceIdentifier,omitempty"`
