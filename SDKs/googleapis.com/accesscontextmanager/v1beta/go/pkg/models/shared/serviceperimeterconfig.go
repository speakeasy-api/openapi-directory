// ServicePerimeterConfig - `ServicePerimeterConfig` specifies a set of Google Cloud resources that describe specific Service Perimeter configuration.
type ServicePerimeterConfig struct {
	// A list of `AccessLevel` resource names that allow resources within the `ServicePerimeter` to be accessed from the internet. `AccessLevels` listed must be in the same policy as this `ServicePerimeter`. Referencing a nonexistent `AccessLevel` is a syntax error. If no `AccessLevel` names are listed, resources within the perimeter can only be accessed via Google Cloud calls with request origins within the perimeter. Example: `"accessPolicies/MY_POLICY/accessLevels/MY_LEVEL"`. For Service Perimeter Bridge, must be empty.
	AccessLevels []string `json:"accessLevels,omitempty"`
	// A list of Google Cloud resources that are inside of the service perimeter. Currently only projects are allowed. Format: `projects/{project_number}`
	Resources []string `json:"resources,omitempty"`
	// Google Cloud services that are subject to the Service Perimeter restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if `storage.googleapis.com` is specified, access to the storage buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access restrictions.
	RestrictedServices []string `json:"restrictedServices,omitempty"`
	// Google Cloud services that are not subject to the Service Perimeter restrictions. Deprecated. Must be set to a single wildcard "*". The wildcard means that unless explicitly specified by "restricted_services" list, any service is treated as unrestricted.
	UnrestrictedServices []string `json:"unrestrictedServices,omitempty"`
	// Specifies how APIs are allowed to communicate within the Service Perimeter.
	VpcAccessibleServices *VpcAccessibleServices `json:"vpcAccessibleServices,omitempty"`
