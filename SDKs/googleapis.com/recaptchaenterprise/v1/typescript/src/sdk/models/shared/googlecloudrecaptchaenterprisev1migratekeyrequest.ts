A reCAPTCHA Enterprise key or migrated key behaves differently than a reCAPTCHA (non-Enterprise version) key when you reach a quota limit (see https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/quotas#quota_limit). To avoid any disruption of your usage, we check that a billing account is present. If your usage of reCAPTCHA is under the free quota, you can safely skip the billing check and proceed with the migration. See https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/billing-information.
