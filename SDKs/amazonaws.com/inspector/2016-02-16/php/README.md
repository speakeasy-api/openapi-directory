## Available Resources and Operations

### [SDK](docs/sdk/README.md)

* [addAttributesToFindings](docs/sdk/README.md#addattributestofindings) - Assigns attributes (key and value pairs) to the findings that are specified by the ARNs of the findings.
* [createAssessmentTarget](docs/sdk/README.md#createassessmenttarget) - Creates a new assessment target using the ARN of the resource group that is generated by <a>CreateResourceGroup</a>. If resourceGroupArn is not specified, all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are included in the assessment target. If the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_slr.html">service-linked role</a> isn’t already registered, this action also creates and registers a service-linked role to grant Amazon Inspector access to AWS Services needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50 assessment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500 concurrent agents per AWS account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_applications.html"> Amazon Inspector Assessment Targets</a>.
* [createAssessmentTemplate](docs/sdk/README.md#createassessmenttemplate) - Creates an assessment template for the assessment target that is specified by the ARN of the assessment target. If the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_slr.html">service-linked role</a> isn’t already registered, this action also creates and registers a service-linked role to grant Amazon Inspector access to AWS Services needed to perform security assessments.

* [createResourceGroup](docs/sdk/README.md#createresourcegroup) - Creates a resource group using the specified set of tags (key and value pairs) that are used to select the EC2 instances to be included in an Amazon Inspector assessment target. The created resource group is then used to create an Amazon Inspector assessment target. For more information, see <a>CreateAssessmentTarget</a>.
* [deleteAssessmentRun](docs/sdk/README.md#deleteassessmentrun) - Deletes the assessment run that is specified by the ARN of the assessment run.
* [deleteAssessmentTarget](docs/sdk/README.md#deleteassessmenttarget) - Deletes the assessment target that is specified by the ARN of the assessment target.

* [describeRulesPackages](docs/sdk/README.md#describerulespackages) - Describes the rules packages that are specified by the ARNs of the rules packages.
* [getAssessmentReport](docs/sdk/README.md#getassessmentreport) - Produces an assessment report that includes detailed and comprehensive results of a specified assessment run. 
* [getExclusionsPreview](docs/sdk/README.md#getexclusionspreview) - Retrieves the exclusions preview (a list of ExclusionPreview objects) specified by the preview token. You can obtain the preview token by running the CreateExclusionsPreview API.
* [getTelemetryMetadata](docs/sdk/README.md#gettelemetrymetadata) - Information about the data that is collected for the specified assessment run.
* [listAssessmentRunAgents](docs/sdk/README.md#listassessmentrunagents) - Lists the agents of the assessment runs that are specified by the ARNs of the assessment runs.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
