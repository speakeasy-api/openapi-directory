 * ProxyCreatePaymentGatewayOptionData - A field used to pass gateway options. Zuora allows you to pass in special gateway-specific parameters for payments that go through the Adyen, Autorize.et, CyberSource, Merchant eSolutions, Orbital (Chase Paymentech), QValent, Vantiv, and Verifi gateways.
 * 
 * For each of these special parameters, you supply the name-value pair and Zuora passes it to the gateway. This allows you to add functionality that's supported by a specific gateway but currently not supported by Zuora.
