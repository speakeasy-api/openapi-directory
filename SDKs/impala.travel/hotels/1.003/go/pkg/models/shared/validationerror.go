// ValidationError - Your request wasn't formatted correctly and therefore couldn't be processed. This most frequently happens when query parameters or request body values are missing, incorrectly formatted or added where they don't exist (e.g. due to typos). We're including a list of `validations` to point out where things are going wrong and should be fixed.
