// ImageObjectDetectionModelMetadata - Model metadata specific to image object detection.
type ImageObjectDetectionModelMetadata struct {
	// Optional. Type of the model. The available values are: * `cloud-high-accuracy-1` - (default) A model to be used via prediction calls to AutoML API. Expected to have a higher latency, but should also have a higher prediction quality than other models. * `cloud-low-latency-1` - A model to be used via prediction calls to AutoML API. Expected to have low latency, but may have lower prediction quality than other models. * `mobile-low-latency-1` - A model that, in addition to providing prediction via AutoML API, can also be exported (see AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile or edge device with TensorFlow afterwards. Expected to have low latency, but may have lower prediction quality than other models. * `mobile-versatile-1` - A model that, in addition to providing prediction via AutoML API, can also be exported (see AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile or edge device with TensorFlow afterwards. * `mobile-high-accuracy-1` - A model that, in addition to providing prediction via AutoML API, can also be exported (see AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile or edge device with TensorFlow afterwards. Expected to have a higher latency, but should also have a higher prediction quality than other models.
	ModelType *string `json:"modelType,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The number of nodes this model is deployed on. A node is an abstraction of a machine resource, which can handle online prediction QPS as given in the qps_per_node field.
	NodeCount *string `json:"nodeCount,omitempty"`
	// Output only. An approximate number of online prediction QPS that can be supported by this model per each node on which it is deployed.
	NodeQPS *float64 `json:"nodeQps,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The reason that this create model operation stopped, e.g. `BUDGET_REACHED`, `MODEL_CONVERGED`.
	StopReason *string `json:"stopReason,omitempty"`
	// The train budget of creating this model, expressed in milli node hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour. The actual `train_cost` will be equal or less than this value. If further model training ceases to provide any improvements, it will stop without using full budget and the stop_reason will be `MODEL_CONVERGED`. Note, node_hour = actual_hour * number_of_nodes_invovled. For model type `cloud-high-accuracy-1`(default) and `cloud-low-latency-1`, the train budget must be between 20,000 and 900,000 milli node hours, inclusive. The default value is 216, 000 which represents one day in wall time. For model type `mobile-low-latency-1`, `mobile-versatile-1`, `mobile-high-accuracy-1`, `mobile-core-ml-low-latency-1`, `mobile-core-ml-versatile-1`, `mobile-core-ml-high-accuracy-1`, the train budget must be between 1,000 and 100,000 milli node hours, inclusive. The default value is 24, 000 which represents one day in wall time.
	TrainBudgetMilliNodeHours *string `json:"trainBudgetMilliNodeHours,omitempty"`
	// Output only. The actual train cost of creating this model, expressed in milli node hours, i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour. Guaranteed to not exceed the train budget.
	TrainCostMilliNodeHours *string `json:"trainCostMilliNodeHours,omitempty"`
