// DNSRecordCreationState - <p>Describes the creation state of the canonical name (CNAME) records that are automatically added by Amazon Lightsail to the DNS of a domain to validate domain ownership for an SSL/TLS certificate.</p> <p>When you create an SSL/TLS certificate for a Lightsail resource, you must add a set of CNAME records to the DNS of the domains for the certificate to validate that you own the domains. Lightsail can automatically add the CNAME records to the DNS of the domain if the DNS zone for the domain exists within your Lightsail account. If automatic record addition fails, or if you manage the DNS of your domain using a third-party service, then you must manually add the CNAME records to the DNS of your domain. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/verify-tls-ssl-certificate-using-dns-cname-https">Verify an SSL/TLS certificate in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p>
