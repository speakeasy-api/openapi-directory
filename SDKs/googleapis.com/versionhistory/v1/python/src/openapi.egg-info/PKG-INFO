## Available Resources and Operations


### platforms

* `versionhistory_platforms_channels_list` - Returns list of channels that are available for a given platform.
* `versionhistory_platforms_channels_versions_list` - Returns list of version for the given platform/channel.
* `versionhistory_platforms_channels_versions_releases_list` - Returns list of releases of the given version.

<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
