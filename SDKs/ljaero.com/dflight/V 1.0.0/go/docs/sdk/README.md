## Overview

[DFlight API](https://ljaero.com/solutions/dflight/) supplies the up-to-date information needed for compliance with UAV preflight assessment requirements. Separate endpoints are available for each of the following information categories:
- Airspace
- Weather
- Temporary Flight Restrictions
- Special Security Areas
- Restricted Public Venues
- Surface Obstacles
- Aerodromes
- UAS Operating Areas

You can define your geographic area of interest in one of three convenient ways:
- Providing a latitude/longitude point and distance around that point
- Providing a GeoJSON LineString defining your route
- Providing an arbitrary GeoJSON Polygon defining your area of interest
