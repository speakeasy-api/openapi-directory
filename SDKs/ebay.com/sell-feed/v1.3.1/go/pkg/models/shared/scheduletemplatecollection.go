// ScheduleTemplateCollection - The type that defines the fields for a paginated result set of schedule templates. The response consists of 0 or more sequenced <em> pages</em> where each page has 0 or more items.
type ScheduleTemplateCollection struct {
	// The path to the call URI that produced the current page of results.
	Href *string `json:"href,omitempty"`
	// The value of the <strong>limit</strong> parameter submitted in the request, which is the maximum number of schedule templates to return per page, from the result set. A result set is the complete set of schedule templates returned by the method. <p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> Though this parameter is not required to be submitted in the request, the parameter defaults to 10 if omitted.</span></p><p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> If this is the last or only page of the result set, the page may contain fewer tasks than the <strong>limit</strong> value. To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total number of tasks matching input criteria) by this limit value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the <strong>total</strong> value was <code>120</code> (120 total tasks) and the <strong>limit</strong> value was <code>50</code> (show 50 tasks per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate <strong>getScheduleTemplates</strong> calls to view all tasks matching the input criteria.</span></p>

	// The number of results skipped in the result set before listing the first returned result. This value can be set in the request with the <b>offset</b> query parameter. <p class="tablenote"><strong>Note: </strong>The items in a paginated result set use a zero-based list where the first item in the list has an offset of <code>0</code>.</p>
