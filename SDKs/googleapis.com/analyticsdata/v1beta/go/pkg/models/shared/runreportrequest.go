// RunReportRequest - The request to generate a report.
type RunReportRequest struct {
	// The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report.
	CohortSpec *CohortSpec `json:"cohortSpec,omitempty"`
	// A currency code in ISO4217 format, such as "AED", "USD", "JPY". If the field is empty, the report uses the property's default currency.
	CurrencyCode *string `json:"currencyCode,omitempty"`
	// Date ranges of data to read. If multiple date ranges are requested, each response row will contain a zero based date range index. If two date ranges overlap, the event data for the overlapping days is included in the response rows for both date ranges. In a cohort request, this `dateRanges` must be unspecified.
	DateRanges []DateRange `json:"dateRanges,omitempty"`
	// To express dimension or metric filters. The fields in the same FilterExpression need to be either all dimensions or all metrics.
	DimensionFilter *FilterExpression `json:"dimensionFilter,omitempty"`
	// The dimensions requested and displayed.
	Dimensions []Dimension `json:"dimensions,omitempty"`
	// If false or unspecified, each row with all metrics equal to 0 will not be returned. If true, these rows will be returned if they are not separately removed by a filter. Regardless of this `keep_empty_rows` setting, only data recorded by the Google Analytics (GA4) property can be displayed in a report. For example if a property never logs a `purchase` event, then a query for the `eventName` dimension and `eventCount` metric will not have a row eventName: "purchase" and eventCount: 0.
	KeepEmptyRows *bool `json:"keepEmptyRows,omitempty"`
	// The number of rows to return. If unspecified, 10,000 rows are returned. The API returns a maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter how many you ask for. `limit` must be positive. The API can also return fewer rows than the requested `limit`, if there aren't as many dimension values as the `limit`. For instance, there are fewer than 300 possible values for the dimension `country`, so when reporting on only `country`, you can't get more than 300 rows, even if you set `limit` to a higher value. To learn more about this pagination parameter, see [Pagination](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination).
	Limit *string `json:"limit,omitempty"`
	// Aggregation of metrics. Aggregated metric values will be shown in rows where the dimension_values are set to "RESERVED_(MetricAggregation)".
	MetricAggregations []RunReportRequestMetricAggregationsEnum `json:"metricAggregations,omitempty"`
	// To express dimension or metric filters. The fields in the same FilterExpression need to be either all dimensions or all metrics.
	MetricFilter *FilterExpression `json:"metricFilter,omitempty"`
	// The metrics requested and displayed.
	Metrics []Metric `json:"metrics,omitempty"`
	// The row count of the start row. The first row is counted as row 0. When paging, the first request does not specify offset; or equivalently, sets offset to 0; the first request returns the first `limit` of rows. The second request sets offset to the `limit` of the first request; the second request returns the second `limit` of rows. To learn more about this pagination parameter, see [Pagination](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination).
	Offset *string `json:"offset,omitempty"`
	// Specifies how rows are ordered in the response.
	OrderBys []OrderBy `json:"orderBys,omitempty"`
	// A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). Within a batch request, this property should either be unspecified or consistent with the batch-level property. Example: properties/1234
	Property *string `json:"property,omitempty"`
	// Toggles whether to return the current state of this Analytics Property's quota. Quota is returned in [PropertyQuota](#PropertyQuota).
	ReturnPropertyQuota *bool `json:"returnPropertyQuota,omitempty"`
