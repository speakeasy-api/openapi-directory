/**
 * InvoiceX2yEnum - The type of entities the document is sent from/to: b2b (business-to-business), b2g (business-to-government) or b2c (business-to-consumer). This field does not have a default, but it in mose cases it will be treated as b2b. Only when you explicitly specify b2g or b2c OR when it is clear from the context will a different value be used. For instance, when we see the document is being routed to DE:LWID or NL:OINO number, this tells us it is b2g. But in many cases we are unable to determine this and so it is best to always specify this field. Note that b2b_sez is for use inside India only.
