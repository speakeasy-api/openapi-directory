The items you specify, using either <b>listingId</b> or <b>inventoryReference</b> values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report.<br /><br />For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-reports.html">Promoted Listings reporting</a>.<br /><br />This call returns the URL to the report task in the <b>Location</b> response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID.<br /><br />Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of <code>202</code>, which indicates the report is being generated.
