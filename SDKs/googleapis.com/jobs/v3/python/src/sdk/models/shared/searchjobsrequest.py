When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query \\"program manager,\\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \\"software developer,\\" which does not fall into \\"program manager\\" ontology, but does have \\"program manager\\" appearing in its description. For queries like \\"cloud\\" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \\"cloud\\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value.
