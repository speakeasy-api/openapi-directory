For example, you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if it received the original operation with the same request ID. If it did, it will ignore the second request. The request ID must be a valid [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).
