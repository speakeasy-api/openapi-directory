/**
 * Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this lets you solve two different problems related to routing:
 * 
 * With `round_trip`, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of
 * a bike trip), so we will add some randomness. This requires `ch.disable=true`.
 * With `alternative_route`, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but
 * not too similar to each other. You can control both of these features with additional parameters, see below.
