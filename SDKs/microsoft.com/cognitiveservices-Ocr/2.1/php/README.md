### SDK SDK

* `batchReadFile` - Use this interface to get the result of a Read operation, employing the state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms optimized for text-heavy documents. When you use the Read File interface, the response contains a field called 'Operation-Location'. The 'Operation-Location' field contains the URL that you must use for your 'GetReadOperationResult' operation to access OCR results.​
* `getReadOperationResult` - This interface is used for getting OCR results of Read operation. The URL to this interface should be retrieved from 'Operation-Location' field returned from Batch Read File interface.
* `getTextOperationResult` - This interface is used for getting text operation result. The URL to this interface should be retrieved from 'Operation-Location' field returned from Recognize Text interface.
* `recognizeText` - Recognize Text operation. When you use the Recognize Text interface, the response contains a field called 'Operation-Location'. The 'Operation-Location' field contains the URL that you must use for your Get Recognize Text Operation Result operation.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
