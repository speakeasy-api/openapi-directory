/**
 * GetRouteAlgorithmEnum - Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this parameter lets you solve two different problems related to routing:
 * With `alternative_route`, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but
 * not too similar to each other. 
 * With `round_trip`, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of
 * a bike trip), so we will add some randomness. The `round_trip` option requires `ch.disable=true`.
 * You can control both of these features with additional parameters, see below.
