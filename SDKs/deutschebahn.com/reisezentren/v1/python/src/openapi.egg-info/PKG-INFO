## Available Resources and Operations

### SDK SDK

* `get_reisezentren` - Get all station infos
* `get_reisezentren_loc_lat_lon_` - Get information about a station near a location
* `get_reisezentren_loc_lat_lon_dist_` - Get stations in a given radius

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
