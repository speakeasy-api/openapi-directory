 * Endpoint - `Endpoint` describes a network address of a service that serves a set of APIs. It is commonly known as a service endpoint. A service may expose any number of service endpoints, and all service endpoints share the same service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics. Example: type: google.api.Service name: library-example.googleapis.com endpoints: # Declares network address `https://library-example.googleapis.com` # for service `library-example.googleapis.com`. The `https` scheme # is implicit for all service endpoints. Other schemes may be # supported in the future. - name: library-example.googleapis.com allow_cors: false - name: content-staging-library-example.googleapis.com # Allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the API frontend, for it # to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is allowed # to proceed. allow_cors: true
