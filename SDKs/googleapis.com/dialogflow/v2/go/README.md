If you might use [Agent Assist](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/#aa) or other CCAI products now or in the future, consider using AnalyzeContent instead of `DetectIntent`. `AnalyzeContent` has additional functionality for Agent Assist and other CCAI products. Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions).
* [DialogflowProjectsLocationsAgentSessionsEntityTypesCreate](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsagentsessionsentitytypescreate) - Creates a session entity type.

* [DialogflowProjectsLocationsConversationsCreate](docs/projects/README.md#dialogflowprojectslocationsconversationscreate) - Creates a new conversation. Conversations are auto-completed after 24 hours. Conversation Lifecycle: There are two stages during a conversation: Automated Agent Stage and Assist Stage. For Automated Agent Stage, there will be a dialogflow agent responding to user queries. For Assist Stage, there's no dialogflow agent responding to user queries. But we will provide suggestions which are generated from conversation. If Conversation.conversation_profile is configured for a dialogflow agent, conversation will start from `Automated Agent Stage`, otherwise, it will start from `Assist Stage`. And during `Automated Agent Stage`, once an Intent with Intent.live_agent_handoff is triggered, conversation will transfer to Assist Stage.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !

### SDK Created by [Speakeasy](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/using-speakeasy/client-sdks)
