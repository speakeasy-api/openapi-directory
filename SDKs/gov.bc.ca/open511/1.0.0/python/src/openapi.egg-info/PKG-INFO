## Available Resources and Operations


### resources

* `get_areas` - Lists the geographical areas (e.g. districts) that can be used to filter events.
* `get_events` - Lists road events
* `get_jurisdiction` - Lists the jurisdictions publishing data through this Open511 API implementation
* `get_jurisdictiongeography` - Provides the geographical boundaries for all the jurisdictions.
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
