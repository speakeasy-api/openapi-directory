/**
 * GetPageItemDetailSelectSeasonEnum - Only relevant when loading show detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.
 * 
 * Since the introduction of the D1,2,3 templates this parameter is now somewhat redundant, or less
 * likely to have any effect. While it may still be useful in some cases, most of the time the season
 * selection will be dictated by the configuration of the rows scheduled on the show detail page.
 * This parameter will only take effect if there are rows used to schedule episodes of a season, like
 * D1,2,3, or if no rows have a value set for their `seasonOrder` custom field.
 * 
 * Given a targeted show page, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option
 * provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show embedded in the page.
 * 
 * The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
 * `item_detail_select_season=latest` along with `item_detail_expand=all`. This would then return the
 * detail of the latest season with its list of child episode summaries, and also expand
 * the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries.
