## Available Resources and Operations


### IamPolicies

* `CloudassetIamPoliciesSearchAll` - Searches all the IAM policies within a given accessible Resource Manager scope (project/folder/organization). This RPC gives callers especially administrators the ability to search all the IAM policies within a scope, even if they don't have `.getIamPolicy` permission of all the IAM policies. Callers should have `cloud.assets.SearchAllIamPolicies` permission on the requested scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.

### Resources

* `CloudassetResourcesSearchAll` - Searches all the resources within a given accessible Resource Manager scope (project/folder/organization). This RPC gives callers especially administrators the ability to search all the resources within a scope, even if they don't have `.get` permission of all the resources. Callers should have `cloud.assets.SearchAllResources` permission on the requested scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.

### Maturity

This SDK is in beta and therefore, we recommend pinning usage to a specific package version.
This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

### Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated and maintained programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release !
