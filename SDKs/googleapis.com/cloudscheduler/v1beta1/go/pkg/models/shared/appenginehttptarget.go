// AppEngineHTTPTarget - App Engine target. The job will be pushed to a job handler by means of an HTTP request via an http_method such as HTTP POST, HTTP GET, etc. The job is acknowledged by means of an HTTP response code in the range [200 - 299]. Error 503 is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error. Requests returning error 503 will be retried regardless of retry configuration and not counted against retry counts. Any other response code, or a failure to receive a response before the deadline, constitutes a failed attempt.

For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).

	Body *string `json:"body,omitempty"`
	// HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field names and values. Headers can be set when the job is created. Cloud Scheduler sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but Cloud Scheduler will append `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. * `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true. * `X-CloudScheduler-JobName`: This header will contain the job name. * `X-CloudScheduler-ScheduleTime`: For Cloud Scheduler jobs specified in the unix-cron format, this header will contain the job schedule time in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format. If the job has an body, Cloud Scheduler sets the following headers: * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explictly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the job is created. For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Scheduler. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below are output only. They cannot be set or overridden: * `X-Google-*`: For Google internal use only. * `X-AppEngine-*`: For Google internal use only. In addition, some App Engine headers, which contain job-specific information, are also be sent to the job handler.

	HTTPMethod *AppEngineHTTPTargetHTTPMethodEnum `json:"httpMethod,omitempty"`

If the relative URL is empty, then the root path "/" will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters.
